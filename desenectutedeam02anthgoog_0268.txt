Ο. Papirius. C. Papirius Carbo is meant, who has already been
referred to in chap. xi, § ³9, and chap. xii, § 41. After the word
Papirius the common text adds consul, which Lange and other edi-
tors very correctly remove, as a mere interpolation. Carbo was
not consul, but tribune, when he proposed the law in question,
which was in A.U.C. 622, about two years before the present con·
versation is supposed to have taken place. He did not obtain the
consulship until A.U.c. 634; so that the common reading can not
be correct—De tribunis plebis reficiendis. “ About the re-election
os tribunes of the commons.” The law here referred to provided
that a person might be re-elected to the tribuneship as often as the
people thought advisable‚ It was supported by Caius Gracchus,
but strenuously opposed by the younger Africanus, and was defeat-

Ducem populi Romani, &c ‘⁴ That he was the leader of the Ro·
man people, not the mere follower of their will.” Scipio, on this
occasion, though snus ex populo, that is, though a privatus, placed
himself, by the force of his eloquence, at the head of the people, and
pointed out to them the tuse path, from which they were about to
wander. He became, therefore, a ὀημαγωγός in the highest and
noblest sense of the term, and not one of those populares whose
only object is to flatter the feelings of the multitude, and blindly
follow their will and pleasure. (Compare Seyffert, ad loc.)

Q. Maximo. The allusion is to Q. Fabius Maximus AEmilianus,
elder son of AEmilius Paulus Macedonicus, and who had been adopted
ixito the Fabian family as his brother had been into that of the Scip-
ios. (Compare chap.xix.,§oe.)—comulibus. A,U.C.609; B.0.14⁵.

,-C. Licinii Crassi. This Crassus was a tribune of the commotis
ΒΕ. 145, and proposed a lawto prevent the colleges of priests from
filling up vacancies, and to transfer the election to the people. The
measure was defeated, however, by the speech of the then praetor,
C. Laelius Sapiens. (Brut, 21.)—-Ad populi beneficium transferebatur.

the object os the proposed law was to make this a matter of popu-
lar favor at the comitia—Atque is primus instituit, dcc. ⁸⁶ He was
