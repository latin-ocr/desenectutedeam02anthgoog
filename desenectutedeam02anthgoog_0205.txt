was a disciple os Socrates. He does not appear, however, to have'
profited much by his master’s instructions, is we play trust the test-
· imony os AEschines the Socratic (ap. Athen„ v.‚ 220, A), by whom
he is represented as destitute os refinement, and sordid in his mode*
os living. ”

ᾇ Cyrum ntinorem, dte. ‘⁸ That Cyrus the Younger, the Persian
prince.” With minorem supply natu. He was called the younger,
to distinguish him from the elder cyrus, or Cyrus the Great, the
founder of the Persian empire. Cyrus the Younger was the son of
Darius Nothus, and attempted to dethrone his brother Artaxerxes,
b'ut lost his life in the attempt. He was merely satrap over some

x of. the western provinces of Asia Minor, and-therefore the term re·

gem in the text is to be regarded ass-having merely the force os reg-
ulum. (Compare Freund, ³. v.)-—Imperii gloria. “ In the glory of
his sway,” i. e., his sway as satrap or viceroy, of which Xenophon ι
draws so flattering apicture. (Anab., i., 9.)—-Itysander. ‘Ehe cele·-
brated Spartan commender in the Pe‘loponnesian war. The date
of the narrative given in the text was Rc. 407, when Lysander
was sent· out to suceeed Cratesippidas in the command of the fleet, ,
the Spartane, as it would appear, having been induced to appoint
him, partly because his ability marked him as fit'to eope with Al-
cibiades, and partly that they might have the advantage of his pe-
culiar talents of supple diplomacy at the court of Cyrus the Younger.
-Vir summoe virtutis. The reference here is to ability or merit,
not to moral virtue, in which last the character os Lysander was
particularly deficient. Compare Com. Nep„ Vit. Lym, i.. 1: “Ly-
sander Lacedaemonius magnam reliquit mi samam, magis felicitate quam
virtute partam.”

Sardis. Accusative plural, sor Sardes. Sardis, the ancient cap-
ital of Lydia, at the scot of the 'northern slope os Mount Tmolus, and

N, on the River Pactolus, was the residence, at this time, of Cyrus,

as sanan—Sociis. The PeloponnesianS, and other states which
had confederated against the Atheniens—Communem. ‘⁸ Affable.”
(Compare the Greek κοινός.) 'Phe ordinary text has comem, a much
inferior reading, though retained by Ernesti. Xenophon, in his re-
lation os the affair, has ἄλλα τε φιλοφρονεῖσθαιε Cicero, however,
throughout his whole version of the story, renders Xenophon‘s Greek
very freely, according to his usual enatem, adding some thing‘s,
‚omitting others, and retrenching others.-- Quendam conseptum
agrum. Xenophon calls this τὸν ἐν Σάρδεσι παράδεισον, “ the park'
at Sardi8.” .
