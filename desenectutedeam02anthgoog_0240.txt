Compare with this the Gonpel of St: Muttinem, xii„ 15.

Agrigentinum. “ That a native of Agrigentum.” The allusion
is to Empedocles, the philosopher and poet, who flourished about
B.C. 444.--Vaticinatum (esse). “SangJ’ Vaticinari is here the
same as canere, just as vates is equivalent to poeta—Quen in rerum
natura, &c. “ That whatever cohesions os matter, and whatever
motione of bodies existed in the system of nature, and in the ma-
chinery os the universe, were produced by a principle of friendsbip
or os discord.'' Literally, “ contracted friendship, scattered discord.”
The verses of Empedocles to which Laelius here alludes have been
preserved by Sextus Empiricus. (Adv. Phys„ ix„ 10.) Compare,
also, Diogenes Laertius (viii.‚ 76.)-Aliquod officium exstitit amici.
‘⁴ Any instance of serviceableness on the part of a friend has pre-
sented itsels to the view.'’ Observe that exstitit has here the force
of apparuit. -

Qui clamores, dac. ‘⁴ What plaudite were lately raised throughout
the whole theatre.” Supply sacti sunt. By cavea is meant the
whole interior of an ancient theatre.—M. Pacuvii. Pacuvius, one
of the most celebrated of the early Roman tragedians, was born
about ΒΕ. 220, at Brundisium. He was the son of the sister of
'Ennius—Cum, ignorante rege, ἁο. The play of Pacuvius referred
to in the text was the Duloreste-r, and the part that excited so much
applapse was the contest between the two friends Orestes and Py-
lades, who had gone, in obedience to the advice of Apollo, to the
Tauric Chersonese, where Thoas was king. Here they were seized
by the natives in order to be sacrificed to Diana, according to the
custom os the country, and the friendly altercation'thereupon arose
between them as to which os the two was Orestes. (Compare Cic.,
Dc Fin„ v., 22, 63.)-Ita at erat. “ As he actually was.”—Stantes
plaudebant, dac. The scene proved so exciting that the audience
rose from their seats, and applauded as they stood—Vim suam.
The idea is, that it is nature which forms friendships, and that, if
nature be neglected, no friendship can be stable. (Manna, ad loc.)
—Qui ista disputant. ‘⁶ Who make those things express subjects of
discussion.’' He refers to the philosophers of the day. ’ “
