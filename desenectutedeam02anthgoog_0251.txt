panded (with joy) at the successes of a friend, and contr-acted (with
sorrow) at his missortunes,” i. e„ in order that the beart may ex-
‘ pand with joy at the prosperity of a friend, and shrink with sorrow
at his evil fortune. Supply hominu, or amici. ’

“ CHAPTER xlv,

indication of virtue shine forth, unto which a congenial mind may

beneficii commemoratio.’'-- Ue supra dixi. Compare ohap. xi„ ὑ 37.
