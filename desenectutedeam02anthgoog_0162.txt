ive transcribere. In modern Latinity, however, the employment
of such a present, though osten ocem-ring, is decidedly erroueous.

no reason to complain os old age.'’ Observa that quod is for propter
quod. The ordinary reading is imorem, for which there is hardly
any authority, and which, moreover, is not a Ciceronian term.

perfect in denoting whatever is usual or wont to be done—Sicut
