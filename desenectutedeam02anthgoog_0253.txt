Deliciis diffluentes. “Melting away in sensual delights.” The
reference is to mere selfish sensualists. Observe the peculiar
force of deliciis diffluere, as applied to the dissolving of our mental
and physieal energies in the lap of luxurious indulgence—Nec usu
nec ratione. “Neither by experience nor reflection.'’—- Ut neque
diligat quemquam, διο. “Without loving any one, or being himself
beloved by any one.” Observe here the soree of ut with the nega-
tive, and compare Zumpt, Φ 539. The more literal version will be,
‘⁴ so that he neither love,'' dno„ i. e., on condition that he neither
love—Fides. . “Confidenee.”-Nulla stabilis benevolentiae fiducia.
‘⁸ No firm foundation for lasting good-will.”

eomes the property os him who surpasses them in strength,'’ i. e.,
sor whoever shall invade them with a stronger arm, to him these
will infallibly belong—Inculta et deserta ab amicis. ‘⁴ Unoultivated,
and lying desert, as far as friends are concerned.” On this pecul·
