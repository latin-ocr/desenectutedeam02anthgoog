Roman arms—De moribus facillimis. ‘⁴ Of his most affable man-

tribution of the public lands, in which Scipio opposed the popular
party, he went quietly home, accompanied by the senate, and a great

his bedroom with ‘the intention of writing a speech to be delivered
the following morning. But in the morning he was found dead in
his bed. An investigation into the cause of his death was prevented
by the multitude, and the event remained a secret. Public opinion
pointed out many who were suspected of having murdered him, and
the beaviest suspicion fell upon Papirius Carbo. (Appian, Bell.
