Hac curricula mentis. ⁶⁴ These are the ¹racc-courses pf my mind.”
, We have preferred rendering curricula here literally, in order to
show the full force of the expression. The figure is a very striking
one, and horrowed from the movements of the Ludi Circenses, or
Games of the Roman Circae, and the curricula are the cour-ses
along which the racers pass. Hence by curricula mentis are to be
understood those paths of study and moral exercise so vigorously
pursued by Cato even at the close os his days—Adsum amicit. ‘⁶ I
assist my friends in the courts of lavv.” Supply judicia—Affero.

that we perceive it, and yet do not perceive it.'' (Nauck, Neue

was distinguished as a philosopher, mathematician, general, and
statesman, and was no less admired sor his integrity and virtue,
both in public and private fise. He lived, probably, about 400 B.C.
