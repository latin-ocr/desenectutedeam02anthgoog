Neque enim assentior iis, dre. Laelius here alludes to the doctrines
os the Epicuream, which had not long before this been introduced
at Rome. We must not therefore, as some do, refer the term nuper
to Epicurus himself, since he flourished about two centuries before
Laelius—Plus apud me antiquorum, dre. He advances here two ar-
guments in favor of the immortality os the soul, one derived from
the opinion os the early Romans, the other from the authority of
the Pythagoream as well as of Socrates.—Tam religiosa jura.
‘⁴ Rights so sacred in their nature,'’ i. e„ the right of burial, duc.
(Compare Tusa Πίσῃ, 1., lxm—Nihil ad eos pertinere. ‘⁴ That noth-
ing (of all this) pertained to them,'' i. e., that the dead were in no
way concerned in these.— Vel emm qui in hac terra suerunt. Re-
ferring to the Italic or Pythagorean school, who not only believed
in the‘immouality of the soul. but in its migration into various
bodies—Magnam Graiam. Magna Graecia was an appellation
used to designate the southern part os Italy, in consequence of the
numerous and flou rishing colonies which were founded by the Greeks
in that part of the peninsula—Instituta et preceptis suis erudierunt.
The Pythagor-ean philosophy produced a very beneficial change in
the morale and manners of Magna Graecia—Vel ejus, qui, dte. Al-

hoc tum illud, διο. “ Who did not assert at one time thie, at another
th'at (on the present subject), as he was accustomed to do in most
cases.” Supply dicebat aster illud. Nothing disparaging is here
meant; the allusion is merely to' the so-called irony of Socrates,
which the Academica asterward moulded into their ἐποχή, or suspen-
sion of Judaeum—Sed idem. Some editors add dicebat aster idem,
and omit it in the previous clause—Reque. Valckenaer conjectures
piisque, in his Diaen'b„ p. 55.

Quasi presagire& “As if he had a presentiment of his approach-

ing ἴδηθ’-Ηώς. L. Furius Philus is meant, who was consul
Rc, 136, with Sextus Atilius Serranus. A contemporary of the

⁸ younger Scipio ‘and of Laelius, Philus participated with them in a

love sor Greek literature and refinement. He was particularly cel-
ebrated sor the purity with which he spoke his mother-tongue. He
is introduced by Cicero as one os the speakers in his work pe Rp·
