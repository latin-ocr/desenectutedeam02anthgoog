ward, he assaulted Cicero himself, and compelled him to take refuge
in a neighboring house. cht day he attached the house os Milo,
situated on the eminence called Germalus, but was driven off by Q.
Flaccus. When Marcellinus proposed in the senate that Clodius
should be brought to justice, the friends os the latter protracted the
discussion, so that no decision was made.

ι Clodius was at this time a candidate sor the edileship, that, if
successful, he might be screened from prosecution; and threatened
the city with fire and sword if an assembly were not held for his
electiori. Marcellinus proposed that the senate should decrce that
no election take place till Clodius had been brought to trial. Milo
declared that he would prevent the consul Metellus from holding
the comitia. Accordingly, whenever Metellus attempted to hold an
assembly, he posted himself with a strong body of armed men on
the place of mecting, and stoppcd the procecdings hy giving notice
that he was observing the auspices. In the beginning ofthe follow-
ing year, however, when Milo was no longer in office, Clodius was
elected without opposition ; for, notwithstanding his outrageous,

his proceedings calculated to further their views. The optimates
rejoiced to see him insult and humble the triumvir Pompey, and the
latter to find that he was sufficiently powerful to make the senate
afraid of him. Cicero had many foes and rivals, who openly or se·
cretly encouraged so active an enemy of the obJect of their envy
and dislilre3 while the disturbances which his proceedings occa-
sioned in the city were exactly adapted to further Caesar’s designs.
Clodius, almost immediately after his electiori, impeached Milo sor
public violence. Milo appeared on the second of February to an-
swer the accusation, and the day passed without disturbance. . The
next hearing was fixed for the aiath, and when Pompey stood up to
defend him, Clodius’s party attempted to put him down by raising
a tumult. Milo's party acted in a similar manner when Clodius·
spoke. A· fray ensued, and the judicial proceedjngs were stopped
for that day. 'The matter was put off, by several adjournments, to
the beginning of May, from which time we hear nothing more of it.
In April, Clodius celebrated the Megalesian games, and admitted
· such a number of slaves that the free citizens were unable to find
room. Shortly aster this, the senate consulted the haruspices on
some prodigies which had happened near Rome. They replied,
that, among‘ other things which had provoked the anger os the gods,
was the 'desecration of sacred places. Clodius interpreted this as
