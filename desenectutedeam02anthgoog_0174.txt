which Statius preserved in Latin characters, Symplu’zbi. Statius,
whose full name was Caecilius Statius, and who is called Caecilius at
the· commencement of the next chapter, was a Latin comic poet,
and originally a Gallic sleve. His productione were held in high
estimation by the Romans, who classed him sor the most part with
Plautus and Terence. He died Ro. 168, one year after Ennius.
Being originally a slave, he bore the servile appellation os Statius,
which was asterward‚ probably when he received his freedom, con-
verted into a sort os cognomen, and he thenceforth became known
as Caecilius Statius. ’”

Nec vero dubitet agricola, «stc. ‘⁸ N or, indeed, let any husbandmen,
however advanced in years, hesitate to reply,” dvc„ i. e„ every hus-
bandmen, no matter how old, ought to reply, etc. The true reading
here is dubitet, so that neo dubitet is equivalent, in fact, to nm· est,

CHAPTER VIII.

Melius cecilius, duc. ‘⁴ Caecilius has expressed this sentiment
respecting an old man (thus) exercising foresight for the benefit of
a coming age, in a better spirit than (he), the eeme' (poet), has that
other one,” i. e., the line which we have Just given from Caecilius
Statius respecting the old man planting trees sor another generationi,
is conceived in a much better spirit than that other passage from
the pen of the same poet, namely‚ dcc. With vocilius supply hoo
dixit or something equivalent.—AEdepol, senectus, duc. ‘⁶ Depend
upon it, old age‚” duc. There must be a comma after senectus, as
this is an address to age. The lines here quoted are from a play
of Statius, entitled ‘⁸ Plocius,'’ as we learn from Nonius (ε. b. adve-
nire). The measure is iambic trimeter. In the first line oedepd is
pronounced as a dissyllable, and forms a spondee; and in the third
da'u becomes e monosyllable, forming the latter half os e spondeo:

person to the third, from senectus to senem—Ec multafortasaee. Sup-
