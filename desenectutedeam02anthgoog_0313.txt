trust of the optimates, while Caesar endeavored to increase the
estrangement by promoting a union between Pompey aud Crassus
in popular mensures. With their united support the lex Aurelia
was carried, by which the judices were selected from the populus
(represented by the. tribuni erarii) and equites as well as the sen-

= ate, whereas the senate had possessed the judicia exclusively dur·

ing the preceding twelve years, by the lex Cornelia of Sulla. The
jealousy of Crassus, however, prevented any cordiality of senti·
ment, or general unity of action. He saw himself overborne by the
superior authority of his colleague. Το gain favor, he entertained
the populace at a banquet of ten thousand tables, and distributed
corn enough to supply the family os every citizen for three months;
but all this was insufficient to outweigh the superior personal con-
sideration os Pompey. The coolness between the consuls became
a matter of public observation, and,‘on the last ‘day of the year, the
knight C. Aurelius (probably at the instigation of Caesar) mounted
the tribune, and announced to the assembled multitude that Jupiter,
who had appeared to him in a dream the night before, invited the
consuls to be reconciled before they lest office. Pompey remained
cold and inflexible, but Crassus took the first step by offering his
hand to his rival, in the midst of general acclamations. The recon-
ciliation‚ however, was hollow, for the jealousy of Crassus contin·

Maniliau law, which conferred the command against Mithradates
upon Pompey, rankled in the mind of Crassus. When Pompey re-
turned victorious‚ Crassus, from timidity or disgust, retired for a
time from Rome.

ln the year B.C. 65, Crassus was censor with Q. Catulus, the
firm supportet· of the senate; but the censore, in consequence of ·
their political discordance, passed the period ‘of their office without
holding a census or a muster of the equites. In the following year
Crassus failed in his wish to obtain the rich province of Egypt.

Crassus was suspected by some, probably without sufficient rea·
son, of being privy to the first conspiracy of Catilium and again, in
the year B.C. 63, L. Tarquinius, when he was arrested on his way
to Catiline, affirmed that he was sent by Crassus, with a message
inviting Catiline to come with speed to· the rescue of his friends at
Rome; but the senate· denounced the testimony of Tarquinius as a
calumny, and Crassus himself attributed the charge to the suborna-
tion of Cicero. (Sua, B. 0., 48.) The interests of Crassus were

opposed to the success of the conspiracy3 for it would have required
