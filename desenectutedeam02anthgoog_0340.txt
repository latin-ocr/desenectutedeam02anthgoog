P. Consanus Souuo AErrxnuxus Armenius Minos, son of L.
AEmilius Paulus, and adopted son os P. Cornelius Scipio (son os
Africanus the Elder), must have been born about 185 Ro. ; sor in
168 Bc, being then ,a youth in his seventeenth year, he took a
very active part in the battle of Pydna, in which his father defeated
Perseus, king of Macedonia. (Ida, xliv„ 44; Flac„ Vit. AEm. Paul„
22.) From his earliest years he had an ardent love of intellectual
occupatione, and cultivated the friendship of men like Polybius,
Panaetius, Laelius, and others. It was, perhaps, on this account that
he appeared to his relatives to he wanting in youthful vigor, and no
great hopes were entertained of him. But, with his partiality for
science, and-Greek refinement, and art, he esteemed no less the
stem virtues of the best of the Romans. Old Cato was, in this re-
spect, his model.

At the beginning of the third Punic war, 151 B.c., when no one
was willing tc enter his name, either as an officer or as a common
soldier, for the campaign in Spain, Scipio, although h was at this
same time requested hy the Macedoniam to settle some disputes
among themselves, came forward and declared that he would gladly
accept any post that might be assigned to him. This example in-
spired with courage even those who had hitherto kept back. (Lim,
Epit„ 4e; Polyb„ xxxv„ 4.) Scipio thus became military tribune
under L. Lucullus. Two heroic deeds of Scipio in this expedition
are recorded: he was the only Roman who ventured to accept the
“ challenge of a huge Spanish chief, whom he slew in single combas.
He was- also the first to scale the walls os the town os Interca-
tia while it was besieged by the Romans. These proofs of perss
sonal contage, and »his other virtues, filled even the enemy with
admiration, and gained for him a greater influence over the Span-
