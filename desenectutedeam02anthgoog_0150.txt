De ceteris. ‘⁶ Of the other topics ‘connected with it,” i. e„ of the
other praises and parts of philosophy. Compare Wetzel: ‘⁸ de οι-

fers ceteris to the other periods of life, and explains it as follows:
‘⁸ de ceteris etatis temporibus et vitoe partibus, quibus medetur philoso-
phia.”—Hunc librum, dte. Goez maintains that we must read mne
in place os hunc, and ”accimus sor misimus. But there is no need
whatever of any change, since the pronoun os itsels carries with it
the idea of present time, while misimm is far more in accordance
with the Latin epistolary style than nu'm‘mus would be.

Tithono. Tithonus, son of Laomedon, became a savorite of Au-
rora, who obtained sor him immortality from Jove, but forgot to ask,
at the same time, for undecaying youth. He attained, therefore, to
a very advauced, but helpless and wretched old age, until the god·
dese, out of compassion‚ changed him into a τέττιξ, οι· cicada. (schol.
ad 11.. xi„ 1.—Tzetz. ad Lycophr„ 18.)-Ut Aristo Cius. “As Aristo
of Ceos has done.” Supply fecit. , Aristo was a peripatetic philos-
opher, and a native of the Island of Ceos (Κὲως), where his birth-
place was the town of Iulis (Ἰουλίς). He succeeded, after the
death of his master Lycon, to the management of the peripatetic
school, about Bc. 230. He is osten confounded with Aristo of
Chios, the stoic philosopher and disciple of zena—Cius. The edi·
tions fluctuate between Chius and Ceus, the greater number, and
among them Orelli’s, having Chius. The form Cius, however, is .
decidedly preferable in this place. The corresponding Greek ad-
jective is Κεῖος. consult Spalding, ad Quintil„ iii., 1, 10, not. crit,

Parum enim esset auctoritatis in sabula. The remarks of an im-
aginary character like Tithonus would cari-y little weight with them,
whereas those ascribed to Cato in the present essay are perfectly
consistent with his true character, or expressly verified by authen-
tic history.--M. Catoni seni. “To Marcus Cato, the elder. '³
Marcus Porcius Cato, usually styled the censor, from the remarkable
spirit and integrity with which he discharged the duties of that office.
