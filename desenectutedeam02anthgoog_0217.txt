Vobis. ‘⁴ To you‚” i. e„ to you, two young men of generous feel:
ings, liberally educated, and who will receive in a proper spirit what
Ι may now be going to impart.—Gemere. ⁴⁴ Το understand.”—-Vee-
eros patres. L. AEmilius Paulus and Caius Laelius. Laelius, the⁴
father, was from early manhood the friend and companion of Afri-
canus the Elder, as his son aster-ward was of Africanus the Youn-
gen—In his compagibus comario. ‘⁴ Within this stame-work os the
body.” Literally, “within these joinings of the πῖθ’-Μυκη
‘quodam necessitatis, dcc. ‘⁴ We discharge a certain duty of neces-
sity, and a disagreeable task.’'-Est enim animus caelestis, dcc. That
the soul had an existence prior to her connection with the body
seems to have been an opinion os the highest antiquity, as it may be
traced in the Chaldaean, Egyptian, and Grecian theology, as sar
back as there are any records remaining of their speculative tenete.
(Compare Taso. Βίῳ, i., 22, 513 Om'a, Met„ i., 78, eeq.,· Heyne,
Excurae. xiii. ad Vis-gx, AEn„ vi.‚ Two—Spaniam ‘⁸ Have dissemin-
ated.” A metaphor horrowed from the sowing or scattering of
seed.— Ut essent. ‘⁴ That there might be (aclass of beings).’'- Vieoe
modo atque constantia. ⁴⁸ In the steadiness and regularity os their
mode os life.”—Raeio ac disputatio. “ Reason and argument,” i. e.‚
reflection and inquiry.-Nobilitae. ‘⁴ The high rank.”

Incola: paene nostros. “ Inhabitants almost of our own country.”
Pythagoras, aster traveling in many countries, fixed his residence
among the Italian Greeks, in Magna Graecia, and particularly at
Crotona. Hence Cato styles him and his followers ⁴⁸ incolas pam
nostros,” from their inhabiting a part of the same peninsula with the
Romane, and more particularly from their bearing the name of the
Italic school.-—Qui cuent Italici, dcc. ‘⁴ Since they were formerly
denominated the Italic philosophers.” Observe the employment os
the subjunctive here with the relative, ,and consult Zumpt, ᾁ 564.-
Italici. Not Itali, which latter would only have been employed thus
by the poets.—-Ex universa mente divina delibatos. ‘⁴ Called from'
the' universal soul divine.’' Pythagoras maintained that the human
soul was an emanation from the great soul os the universe, a doc-
trine adopted by many other philosophem, and very probably of early
Oriental origin.
