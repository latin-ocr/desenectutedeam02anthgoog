⁸⁴ Cum eo quartum coraule adolescemulas miles ad Capuam profectus
sum, quintoque anno post ad Tarentum quoestor .- deinde aditis, quadri-
enm'o pose factus sum ναίω-θ’ There is no doubt whatever that
this reading is corrupt and interpolated, since it is at variance with
the accounts both of ancient historiam and of Cicero himself. In
the first place, Cato was not quaestor at the siege os Tarentum, but
in Αἰτίοις nor under Fabius Maximae, but Scipio Africanus; and,
moreover, so far was he from being a quaestor at the siege of the
place in question, that he sei-ved on this occasion merely as a pri-
vate soldier (miles). In the next place, there is no reason whatever
why he should speak os himself, in this passage, as aedile and pne-
tor, when his object is not to make any mention of himself, save
only so far as will enable him to tell the praises of Fabius. Again,
he did not fill the praetorship in the year when Tuditanus and Cethe-
gus were consuls, but merely the office of quaestor, a fact of which
Cicero himself is a witness. (Brut, 15, 6.) And, finally, he was not
praetor four years aster his aedilesliip, but the very next year. We
ought to have no hesitation, therefore, in rejecting oedilis and prator
from the text, with Pighius (Annal. Rom, ad ann. 549, p. 219), and
by a change of punctuation restoring his own to Cicero. (Wetzel,

Legis Cincio. The La Ginaia, called also Mummii-r, was passed
in the time of the tribune Μ. Cincius Alimentus (Rc. 204), and not
only forbade a person to take any thing for his pains in pleading a
cause, but applied also to gists in general, limiting in the latter case
the amount of what a person could give, and also requiring such
gifts to be accompanied by certain formalities. (Dict. Ant„ s. v.)

Et Hannibalem juveniliter exultantem, dte. ‘⁴ And by his patient per-
severance calmed down Hannibal, when exulting with all the ardor
of a youthful conqueror.” Literally, ‘⁶ exulting like a young man.”
Hannibal was about thirty years of age when he entered ltaly, and
in his sorty-fourth year when he left that country and returned to
Carthage.—Familiaris noster. When Catu, who had filled the office
of quaestor under Scipio Africanus in the war against Carthage‚ was
returning home, he found Ennius in Sardinia, became acquainted
with his high powers, and brought him in his train to Rome, where
he ever after lived on terms of intimacy with Cato and other emi-
nent men of the day.
