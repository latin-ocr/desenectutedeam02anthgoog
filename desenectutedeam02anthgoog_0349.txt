2. The person addressed iu the prefhce, or introduction, must be
Pomponius Atticus, the friend of Cicero. This is fully proved by a
passage in the life of Cato (sub fin.), where we read, ‘⁴ Hujus de vita
et moribus plura m eo libro persecuti sumus quem separatim de eo feci·
mua rogatu Pomponii Atticiss’ which is unquestiouably persectly de·

as it were, from the rest in all.

3. The losty tone in which the grandeur and power of the Roman
people are celebrated, the holdness of the comments on free iusti-
tutions and tyrauts, would have been totally out os place at an epoch

οι· degradation aud slavery. 'Allusions, also, it is amr-med, may be '

detected to the civil war between Caesar and Pompey. Upon a care-
sul examinatior: os all the quotations·adduced, it will be seen that
no weight ought to be attached to this portion of the proos.

4. Lambinus was informed, upon what he considered good au·
ι thority, that one MS. ended in this manner: ‘⁶ Completum est opus
AEmilii Probi, cmlii Nepotis.” But, even is we admit the accu-
raey of a statement vouched for so imperfectly, it leads to no result,
sor the first clause might be intended to assign the twenty biogra-
phies, the Dc Regibus, the Hamilcar, and the Hannibal, to Probum
the concluding phrase to mark Nepos as the author of the Cato aud
the Atticus. .

The question thus started has given rise to interminable discus-
sions; but the leading hypotheses may be reduced to three:

1. Many of the contemporaries of Lambinus, unable or unwilling
to abandon the belief in which they had been reared, and clinging

to the verses addressed to Theodosius, dqgge'dly maintained that ν

the old opinion was, aster all, tru03 and that all the lives, except,
perhaps, those os Cato and Atticus, which stood upon somewhat
different ground, were the property os Probus, and os no one else.
This position is now very generally abandoned

· 2. Lambinus, as we have seen, pronouneed the lives to belong
entirely to Cornelius Nepos. These who support this hypothesis,
¹ which has been more widely received than any other, hold that
what we now possess may be regarded either as a portion os the

· voluminous collection, De Vim Illa-utribus, or as an independent

work, which, having fallen into oblivion, was brought to light by
AEmilius Probus, who fraudulently endeavored to palm it off as his “
own, or, perhaps, meant to do nothing more than claim the credit
of having discovered ansi described it; or, that the verses in ques·
