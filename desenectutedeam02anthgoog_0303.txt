that he had misgivings as to the result. The triumvirs had not yet

taken Clodins's side; and when he impeached L. Calpurnius Piso ’

sor extortion, their influence procured the acquittal of the accused.
But, in defending C. Antonius, Cicero provoked the triumvirs, and
especially Cassan and within three hours aiter the delivery of his
speech, Clodius became the adopted son of P. Fonteius, The lex
curiata for his adoption was proposed by Caesar, and Pompey pre-
sided in the assembly. The whole proceeding was irregular, as the
sanction os the pontifices had not been obtained. Fonteius, more-
over, was not twenty years old, and, consequently, much younger
than Clodius, and was married, nor was there the smallest reason
to suppose that his marriage would remain childless; and, indeed, .
he was afterward the father os several children. The rogation, too,
was not made public three nundines before the comitia ; and it was
passed, although Bibulus sent notice to Pompey that he was taking
the auspices. A report soon aster got abroad that Clodius was to
be sent on an embassy to Tigranes, and that by his refusal ta go

‘With the assistance of the latter Clodius succeeded ‚in his object,
and entered upon his office in December, B.C. 59.

Clodius did not immediately assail his enemies. On thelast day

from addressing the peoplc; but his 'first measures were a series es
laws calculated to lay senate, equites, and people under obligations
to him. The first was a law for the gratuitous distribution of corn
once a mouth to the poorer citizens. The next enacted that no
magistrate should observe the heavens on comitial days, and that
no veto should be allowed to hinder the passing os a law, This en-
actment was designed specially to aid him in the attack with which
'hc had 'threatened Cicero. The third was a law sor the restoration ¹
of the old guilds which had been abolished‚ and the· creation of new
ones, by which means he secured the support of a large number of
organized bodies. A fourth law was intended to gratisy those of
a higher class, and provided that the censore should not expel from
the senate, or inflict any mark of >disgracc upon any one who had
not first been openly accused before them, and convicted ot· some,
crime by their joint sentence. The consuls of the year he gained
over to his interests by undertaking to secure to them the provinces
which they Wished. Having thus prepared the way, he opened his
