round and rode up to the scene of dispute, when he was wounded
in the shoulder by one of the gladiators. The fray now became
general. The party of Clodius were put to ssight, and betook them-
selves, with their leader, to a house near Bovillae. Milo ordered
his men to attack the house. Several of Clodius’s men were slain.
and he himself dragged out and dispatched. The body was lest
lying on the road, till a senator, named Sextus Tedius, found it,

and conveyed it to Rome. Here it was exposed to the view of the

populace, who crowded to see it. Next day it was carried naked to·
the forum, and again exposed to view before the rostra. The mob,

enraged by the spectacle, and by the inflammatory speeches os the

tribunes Munatius Plancus and Q. Pompeius Rufus, headed by Sex-

tus Clodius, carried the corpse into the Curia Hostilia, made a fu-

neral pile of the benches, tables, and writings‚ and burned the body

on the spot. Not only the senate-house, but the Porcian Basilica,

erected by Cato the Censor, and other adjoining buildings, were re·

duced to ashes.

Clodius was twice married, first to Pinaria and asterward to Ful·
via: He lest a son, Publius, and a daughter. He inherited no
property from his father. Besides what he obtained by less honest
means, he received some moneys by legacies, and by letting one of
his houses on the Palatine. He also received a considerable dowry
with his wife Fulvia. He was the owner of two houses on the
Palatine Hill, an estate near Alba, and considerable possessione in
Etruria, near Lake Prelius. His personal appearance was effemi-
nate, and neither handsome nor commanding. That he wasa man ³
of great energy and ability there can be little question; still less,
that his character was of the most profligate kind. Cicero himself
admits that he possessed considerable eloquence.

The chief ancient sources sor the life os Clodius are the speeches -

of Cicero pro Gaelio, pro Sextio, pro Milone, pro Domo sua, De Harus-
picum Responsis, in Pisonem, and in Clodium ec Cur-imma, and his
Letters to Atticus and his brother Quintus3 Plutarch’s ,Lives of
Lucullus, Pompey, Cicer0‚ and Cassan and Dio Cassius. Os mod-
ern writers, Middleton, in his Life of Cicero, has touched upon the
leading points of Clodius's history ; but the best and fullest account
⁸has been given in Drumann’s Geschichte Roms, vol. ii„ p. 199-370.
