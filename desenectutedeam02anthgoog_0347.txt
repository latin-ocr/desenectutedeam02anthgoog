Vita T. *Pomponii attici, &c ‘⁸ Lim of· Titus Pomponius Atticus,

. from Cornelius Nepos.” Cornelius Nepoe¹ was the contemporary

and friend of Cicero, Atticus, and Catullus. He wne probably a
native of Verona, or of some neighboring village, and died during
the reign of Augustus. No other particulare, with reg'ard to his
personal history, have been transmitted to us. He ie known to have
written the following pieceS, all of which are now lost:

1. Chronica. An Epitome of Universal History, it would appear,
in three books. For the name, and some idea of the contente, we
are indebted to Ausonius (Epist, xvi), Aulus Gellius (xvii, 21, ἢ 8,

. 8, 24), and Solinus (i., ἡ 2⁷, xliv„ ψ 1); while Catulum, when dedi-

cating his poema to Cornelius Nepos, indicates, though obscur-ely,
the object and extent of the production in question.

2. Exemplorum Libri, of which Charisius (p. 119, ed. funeb.)
quotes the second book, and Aulus Gelliu's (vin, 18, t) ll) the fisth.
This was probably a collection of remarkable eayings and doings,
of the samedeseription aa the compilation subsequently formed by
Valerius Maximus. ,

3. De Viris musto-ibuit. Gellius (xi, 8) tells an ’anecdote of Cato,
adding, ‘⁸ Scriptum est ἧσο in libro Cornelii Nepotis De Illustribus
Viri‘s.” It is not impodsible that it may be the same work ae the
preceding, quoted under a different title. ·

4. Vita Cicer-onie, an error in which in corrected by Aulus Gel-
nus (κν, 28).

5. Epistulae ad Cinam, from one of which Lactantius bno pre-
served an extract (Imm. Die, iii„ 15)··, but we can not tell whether ¹
they were ever formally collected into a volume. ’

“ 6. Perhaps poeme alec, nt least he in named in the came category
with Virgil, Ennius, and AcciuS, by the Younger Pliny (Ep, v., 3).

7. De Historicie. In the Life of Dion (c. 8), which now beare

. the name of Cornelius Nepos, there is t¹he following sentence : υ Sed

² mh, Dia. Dios„ vol. ii„ p. 11⁶6, sqq.
