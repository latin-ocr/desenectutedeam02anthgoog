’ houses, which he let at high rents. He took advantage of the dis-
, tresses and dangers of others to make cheap purchases, Was there
a fire in the city, Crassus might be seen among the throng, bargain·
ing for the houses that were burning or in danger of being burned.
. From such pursuits Crassus was called to action by that servile
.- war, which sprang from and indicated the deplorable state os domes·
tic life in Italy, and was signalized by the romantio adventures and
reverses of the daring, but ill-sated Spartacus. Spartacus had for
many months successfully resisted the generals who had been sent
to oppose him. A revolt so really dangerous had begun to create
alarin, and no confidence was placed in the military talents of the
consuls sor the year B.C. 71, woho regularly, according to a still pre-

and, in the absence os Pompey, who was fighting inspain, the com-

thought worthy of a triumph; but Crassus was honored with an
ovationf and allowed the distinction of wearing a triumpha] crown
orbay (laurus), instead of the ruyrus, which was appropriate to an
ovation.

Crassus now aspired to the consulship, and was not above apply·
ing for assistance to his rival Pompey, who had also announced
himself a candidate. Pompey assumed with pleasure the part of
protector, and declared to the people that he should consider hia
own election valueless unless it were accompanied with that of
Crassus. Both were elected (B. C. 70). Already had Pompey be-
