CHAPTER. III.

Scipionis desiderio. “ By a feeling os regret for Scipio.”—-Viderint
capientes. ‘⁴ luet philosophers determine.'’ The Stoics, for ex-
ample, would praise such apathy, and to the Stoics he here partic-
ularly alludes. According to this school, the sum of a man‘s duty,

‡ with respect to himself, is to subdue his passions of joy and sorroW,

hope and sear, and even pity. And, in proportion as we approach a
state ofapathy, we advance toward persentiam—Manem enim. ‘⁴ For
Ι am indeed moved.”— Ue confirmare possum. ‘gAs 1 may with
confidence assert.”--Non egeo mdicina. ‘⁴ Ι need no external as-

errore careo. ‘⁸ I am free from that erroneous belief,” i. e., that there

date for the aedileship, was unanimously elected consul for the year
147 Β.Ο., though the lawful age for the consulship was forty-three.
Hence the language os the text, “primum ακτὰ tmpus.’' This was
during the third Punic war, and he was immediately sent into Af-

. rica to command the Roman forces. His command of the army

was prolonged for the year 146 B.C., and in the spring os this year
