'the more active employments of existence, so as to settle down
soon into listlessness and indolence—Ante quam essem. ‘⁸ Before
I should become one in the ordinary course of nature.”-Gonvenire
mo. “To have an interview with me‚’? i. e„ to call on me sor ad-
vice orsassistance. —- Cui fuerim occupatus. ‘⁶ For whom I have
been engaged,” i. e., whom I have been prevented from seeing by
other engagements, whether real or pretended. Observe the em-
ployment os the subjunctive here, the relative being equivalent to
ut ei, in consequence of the demonstrative implied in the previous

⁶ clause, the construction being the same as nemo talis adhuc= conve-

nire me voluit, uc ei fuerim occupatus. (Zumpt, Ο 558.)

Ne vos quidem, “Not even you, indeed‚” i. e„ not· even you tWO,
indeed, much less those thafare weaker than you—T. Pontii. This
Titus Pontius is mentioned also in the treatise de Finibus (i., 3), but
nowhefe else. The Romans generally selected sor centurione the
strongest and tallest men. (Vaga, ii.‚ 14.)-Moderatio modo virium,
dcc. “ Let there only be a proper exereise of one's strength.” Ja-
cobs and many others err when they regard moderatio’virium as
equivalent here to ‘⁴ a moderate degree of strength ;” it is rather
capiens virium usus, as Wetzel correctly explains it. Compare
also Nauck: “Manu musa nur recht hau-*hulten mic den Kraften.”
(Neue Jahrb„ 12 supp. vol„ p. 564.)

Olympiae. ‘⁸ At Olympia.” Olympia, in Elia, was the place for
holding the celebrated Olympio games. It was not a city, but the
name was given to' the aggregate of templeS, altars. and other
structures on the banks of the Alpheus, in the immediate vicinity
of the place where the games were held—Per stadium ingressus

esse, dcc. ‘⁴ To have advanced along the whole length of the race-
course, supporting on his shoulderS,” &c The stadium was 600

Greek feet, or 606} English—Cum sustineret. This construction
may be neatly rendered in most cases by the English participle.—
Bovem vivum. The epithet vivum, omitted in some editions, is re-
quired to impart an additional idea of weight. The story, as com-
monly told, makes the animal to have been a heiser of four years
old, and adds, that Milo ate the whole of it in aeingle day. (Comq
pare Quintil„ i., 9; Cic„ de Fat., 13; Ptin„ H. N„ vii , 20 ;1 Val.
Max„ ix., 12, 9.)

Pythagor-ce. Cicero appears to have selected the name of this
philosopher on the present occasion, because he lived in Crotona
at the same time with Milo. (Val. Max„ viii„ 7, ert. 2. Compare
