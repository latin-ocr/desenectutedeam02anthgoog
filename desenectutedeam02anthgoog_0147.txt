Hippocrates. It must be remarked‚ that although Cato was a rigid
follower of the Porch, the doctrines here propounded have little of
the austerity of that sect, but savor more of the gentle and easy dis-
cipline of the ‘Peripatetics (Smith’s Dice. Gr. and Rom. Biog„ dcc„

Ο Tite, ei qnid ego adjuro, &c⁶ ‘⁴ Ο Titus, isin aught I shall have
aided (thee), or shall have lightened the care.” These hexameters
are quoted from the old poet Ennius, who addresses them to Titus

, Quinctius Flamininus, the celebrated Roman commender. But

whether he addressed them in his own person or not, and of what
nature was the distress which is sought to be alleviated, remains a
mere matter of opinion. Most commentators suppose that Ennius
utters these verses himself, and that the distress alluded to was oc-
casioned by the infamous conduct of the brother os Flamininus, who
was expelled in consequence from the senate by Cato, at that time
censor, B.C. 184 (Lim, xxxix„ 42). Drakenborch, however, thinks
thatin the poem of Ennius, from which the lines wei-,e taken, they
were uttered by Sextus AElius Paetus, the colleague of Flamininus
in the consulship, and that the trouble and disquiet of the latter
arose from the alarming prodigies which prevented sor a period his
departure from Rome sor the Macedonian war. (Compare Lim,
mii„ 9.) Drakenborch’s opinion appears the more correct one.
Cicero, on the present occasion, applies these same lines to his
friend Atticus, who had the same prenomen (Titus) as Flamininus,
and whose distress arose from the gloomy state cf public affairs,
as connected with the usurpation of Caesar.
