one should not be able, in consequence of age, to harangue in the
forum or senate, still he may at his own abode impart the lessons
of eloquence and wisdom to young men os promise ; yourself, for in-
stance, Scipi0, or our friend Laelius here—Studiis juventutis. ‘⁸ By

An ne relinquemus. ‘⁴ Shall we not leave.”-Ad omne qfficii munus·
instruat. “ To train them up to every discharge os duty‚” i. e., to
the proper discharge of every duty. The Greek v'ersion has ἄγειν
εἰς ἅπαν namma—Cn. et P. Scipiones. ‘⁸ Cneius and Publius Scip-
io.” These two individuale were brothers, and distinguished them·

· welves by a series of brilliant victories in Spain over the Carthagin-

ians. They both fell in battle, Bc. 211. Cneius was the father
of Scipio Nasica Optimus, and Publius of the elder Africanus—L.
AEmilius et P. Africanus. The L. AEmilius Paulus here meant is
the one that lost his life at Cannae. His son, L. AEmilius Paulus
Macedonicus, the conqueror ot Macedonia, was the father ofAEmil-

ianus, or Scipio Africanus the younger. L.·AEmilius waS, therefore,
“ the natural grandfather of the younger Africanus, and the elder
Africanus his'grandfather by the course of adoption. Hence the
expression in the text, avi tui dua—comitatu. ‘⁴ By a suite.” It
was a favorite old Roman custom, sor the younger Romans, in the
days of the republic‚ to attend upon and form the retinue os distin-¹
guished men, and thus practically acquire the rudiments of states-
manship and wan—Nec ulli bonarum artium, dcc. ‘As some might
object that all old men can not be distinguished sor past exploits,
and can not, therefore, be courted and followed by the young, Cicero
here proceeds to answer this objection by a general remark—Tra·

dit. ‘⁶ Hands over,” An apt expression, and well depicting one
age succeeding to another.

age (according to the 'common account, seventy years old), after a
sage and Socratic discourse to his children and friends. According
to Herodotus, however, he fell in battle' against Tomyris, queen of
the Massageten while Ctesias makes him to have met with his
death from a wound received in battle with a nation called the Der·
hines—L, Metellum. L. Caecilius Metellus, grandstther of Metellus
