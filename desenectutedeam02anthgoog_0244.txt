CHAPTER X.

ᾳ 33.

Nam vel, ut non idem expediret, dec. ‘⁴ For that it osten happened,
either that the same course was not expedient to bot'h parties‚” dec.
—Moree. ⁴⁴ The dispositions.”-Ezemplum. “An illustration.'’—-
lacuatis atatis. ‘⁶ of early life.”—-Sammi puerorum ammes. ‘⁴ The
atrongest attachments on the part of boys-''—Proetexta. The toga
praetexta was laid aside by the Roman youth, generally speaking,
at the close of the fourteenth year, and was succeeded by the toga
virilis· (βία. Ant„ s. v. Impubes.)

§ 34.

Uxorioe conditionis. ‘⁶ In the affair os a wife.” The term con-
ditio is here employed in a peculiar sense, which is well explained
by Gernhard: ‘⁶ Condicio uxoria eet, in qua res uxoria agitur, seu res
quoe ad ducendam pertinet, et contentio rei uxorio, est, cum duo eandem
uxorem poscunt.”-Labesaetari. Supply eam—In optimis quibusque,

best person.'’

demand that they were ready to do all things for the sake osa friend,”
i. e., that they were equally dieposed to make the same unwarrant·
able concessione on their own part—Inveoeratae. The common
reading was inveterata, until Graevius introduced the present one.
The expression inveterata querela is a harah one; not so, however,
inveterata familiaritas. (Compare Cic„ ad Diu.. iii„ 9, 12: “invete-
rata amicitia.’')—Non modo sapientioe, dcc. ‘⁴ Not only a mark os
wisdom, but even of good fortune,” i. e., to require a large share, not
only of good sense, but of good luck.

CHAPTER. XI.
Φ 36.

Quatenus amor, dec. He means, how flu· zeal to serve a friend
ought to carry ue, or, in other words, how thr the claima'of friend-
ehip may reasonably extend—Si Coriolanus habuit amicos. Mel-
