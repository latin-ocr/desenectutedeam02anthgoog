this slight, he still possessed great influence3 for when the tribune
Papirius Carbo proposed a law, that the people should be at liberty
to re-elect their tribunes as osten as they pleased, the eloquent

the mother of the Gracchi, his own wife Sempronia, and Papirius
Carbo, but the heaviest suspicion fell upon the last-mentioned in-
