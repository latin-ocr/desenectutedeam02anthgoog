Nearchus Tarentinus. A Pythagorean philosopher of Tarentum,
who adhered to the cause of the Romans throughout the second

Appius were consuls in Rc. 349, only two years before Plato's .

death, and when he was too old to undertake a journey to Tarentum.
His actual visit to this city was in Rc. 389, on which occasion he
was invited to Syracuse by Dionysius. (Wetzel, ad loc. ,- (θον-πλαγά,
