the son os the censor by his first wife Licinia, and os whom we have
already spoken. Aster serving in the army, he appears to have de·
voted himself to the practice os the law, in which he attained to
considerable eminence. He died when praetor designatus, about
B.c. 152, a few years before his father.——E:rspectatis ad amplissimam
dignitatem. “ Who were expected to attain to the highest preser-
ment,” i. ι., who had by their merits given rise to the expectation
that they would attain one day to the highest honors os the state.
The individuals alluded ιό were the two younger sons 01· L. AEmil-
ius Paulus, and half brothers of the younger Africanus. One of
them, twelve years os age, died only. five days before his father’s
triumph over Perseus, king os Macedonia, and the other, sourteen
years of age, three days only aster the triumph. The loss was all
the severer, since AEmilius had no other sons lest to carry his name
down to pomeray—Quod idem. ‘⁴ Which same thing.”—-Eo meliore
conditione. ‘⁸ So much the better off.”
