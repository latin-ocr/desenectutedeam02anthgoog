CHAPTER IX.

.. <5 27.

Locus c‘zltcr de vitiis senectutis. ‘⁸ The second head concerning
the sailings of age.”—Non plue quam. ‘⁶ Any more than.'‘--Tauri.
‘ Some MSS. and early editions have eires tauri, but vires is better
understood—Quod cet. ‘⁴ What one has.” Equivalent to quod eet
homini a. natura datum—Pro viribus. “ To* the best of your ability.”

, —Quoe voz. ‘⁴ What remark.”—Quam Milonis Crotoniatoe. ‘⁴ Thau .

that os Milo the Crotoniat.” Milo (Μίλων) of Crotona, in Lower
Italy, was an athlete, famous sor his extraordinary hodily strength,
an instance of which is given in the next chapter. His date is as-
certained by the battle os the Crathis, B C. 511, in which he bore an
important part. The manner of his death is thus related: as he
was passing through a forest, when enseebled by age, he saw the
trunk os a tree which had been partially split open by wood-cutters,
and attempted to rend it still further, but the wood closed upon his

hands, and thus held him fast, in which state he was attaoked and
devoured by wolves. (Diod. Sic„ xii, 93 Elian, V. Η.. ii., 24.)
Lacertoe. The term lacertus is very appropriate here, since it
denotes the most muscular part of the arm, namely‚ from the elbow
to the top os the shoulder‚ and hence it is frequently employed to
signisy “strength‚” as in Hor„ Ep„ ii., 2, 4⁷: ‘⁴ Goesaris Aug-usti
,ηοπ responsura lacertis.'' The term brachium denotes the arm from
the hand to the elbow.--Non vero tam isti, dcc. ‘⁶ In very truth,
those arms os yours are not so dead as you yourself are, driveler.”
. With isti supply lacerti, and observo the reference in isti to the sec-
ond person, or the one addressod. The full expression would be
non tam isti lacerti sunt mortui, quam tu ipse mortuus σε, nugator.
Nihil talc. Supply in se admisit. ‘⁴ Allowed no such remark to
“ be made of him.” Literally‚ ⁴⁴ admitted (or allowed) no such thing
against himsels,” i. e.. to his own disparagement. Translate nihi.
in each of the succeeding clauses by ⁸⁴ nor.’'-—Sextus AElius. Sex·
