BC. a4s; his sixth, in Rc. 299ς the interval, therefore, excluding
both these years, was tany-seven years, not forty-six, as Cicero
makes it. This agrees, moreover, with the account of Valerius
Maximus (viii, 73, 1). Plutarch makes the interval only sorty-five
years. (Vit. Mar„ c. 28.)—Ad senectutis initium esee. ‘⁴ Should be

by Aulus Gellius (x.‚ 28), Servius Tullius, when he classified the
Roman people, divided their ages into three periods: limiting boy-
