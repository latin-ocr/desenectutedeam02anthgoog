term “envoy.”-Absens. This was in B.O. 134, and he‘was pur-
posely chosen to terminate the N umantine war. Some commem-
tators, following the authority of Valerius Maximus, make a dif-
culty here. According to this writer (viii, 15, 4), Scipio was
present at the time, and entered the Campus Martius not as a can·
didate for the consulship, but to procure by his aid and influence the

office os quaestor for his brother Q. Fabius Maximus. He was, how· ·

ever, chosen by the people to the consulship, without even asking
for or expecting it; and -hence Sigonius makes absens here equiva-
lent to mm petens. But this appears sar-fetched, audit seems better
to fall back on the ordinary account—Numantiam exscindet. Nu-
mantia was a town of the Celtiberi, in Spain, on the River Durius
(Doara), not sar from its source. It was reduced by Scipio in B.C.
134 (twelve years aster the destruction of Carthage)‚ after having
resisted the Romans for the space of fourteen, or, according to
another account, twenty years. ι

offendes. ‘⁴ Thou shalt find.” The verb offendo in this sense is
generally applied to something monentem—Nepotis mei. The al·
lusion is to Tiberius Gracchus, the well-known advocate os the
Agr-arian laws, whose mother Cornelia was the daughter of the elder
Africanus. The Gracchian disturbances began at Rome while the
younger Scipio was engaged in the siege of Numantia—Animi, in· x
genii, consiliique tui. ‘⁶ of thy spirit, th'y genius, and thy wisdom.”
—Sed ejus temporis amipiem, dxc. ‘⁶ In relation, however, to this ,
period (of thy lise), 1 see the route os the fates uncertain, as it were,”
i. e„ 1 can not clearly trace the order of the fates at this particular
period of thy existence. A purposely dark allusion to imminent
danger, which was too fatally verified in his death at this time by
the hand of violence. 'consult Emeum, 111.-Sepeenos actm 3015,
anfractus, dic. ⁴⁶ Shall have completed eight times seven oblique
circuite and returns of the sun,‘’ i. ο., eight times seven annual rev-
olutions of the sun. The term anfractus refers to the oblique motion
of the sun through the signs os the zodiac. Scipio died in his fifty· ’
seventh year—Datque ln· numeri. Eight and seven—Quorum uter..
qne plenus, dic. ‘⁸ Each of which is regarded as a perfect one,
(though) the one sor a different reason from the other.” The num·
ber eight was regarded as perfect, on account of its being completely
equa1; and the number seven on account of a certain mathematical
and theurgia excellence which was ascribed to it. (Compare Biihr,
