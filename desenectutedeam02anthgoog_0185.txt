Clientelas. “Clientship8‚” i. e„ clients. (consult Dice. Ant„ ε.
v. cliens.)—Appius. Consult chap. vi„ t) 16.-—Intentum. “On the
stretch.’‘--Imperium. ‘⁶ A kind⁸of empire.’'—Verebantur. A better
reading than reverebantur, as given by some. The *distinction be-
tween the two is well laid down by Gernhard: ‘⁶ Reveremur quos
atate, sapientia, dig-nitate antecedentes observamus,· veremur autem,
quorum imperata, ut ingenui homines, facimus, ut liberi parentum.'’—
Mos patrius et disciplina. “The usages and discipline os our sa-
thers.”

Ita. ‘⁴ In this way.’' Ita, when followed, as here, by si, is equiv-
alent t‘o Ιιοο modo, or, more freely, hac conditione, and not, as some
grammarians maiatum, to tum demum. (Consult Hand, aa Tur-vell„
iii., p. 478.)-Si se ipsa defendit. ‘⁴ If it maintains its own author-
ity.” Literally, ‘⁴ is it· defends itself.”-Si nemini mancipata est.
“If it has been brought under no one's control.” Some editions
give emancipata εει, a much inferior reading. Orelli and Madvig ⁸
have mancipata est, in aecor-<lance with the constant usage of Gaius.
(Consult, also, Gronov„ Obs. in Eccl„ p. 34, as cited by Orelli, ad
loc.)-Dmninatur in suos. “It preserves its proper ascendency over

the members of one’s household.‘' Consult Gemhard’s note in de· ‚

fence of this reading, against the objections of Graevius.

Originum. The reference is to Cato's historica! work entitled
the ‘⁴ Origines‚” of which mention has already been made. The
second and third books treated of the origin of the Italian towns
and communitieS‚ and from these two books the whole work de-
rived its title. The sixth and seventh books continued the narra·
tive to the year os Cato’s death. (Nepos, VitL Cat. Maj„ 3.)-E.st
in manibr-oe. “Is now in hand‚” i. e., 1 am now labor-ing upon it.

be particularly to the ἀποφθέγματα, terse and pointed sayingS, of
which Cato is known to have published a collection. (Cic, De Off,
i., §wo—Nunc quam maim conficio. “1 am now, with all possible
industry, putting the finishing hand to,” i. e., I am now, with all
possible industryg preparing for publication. Cato lest behind him
