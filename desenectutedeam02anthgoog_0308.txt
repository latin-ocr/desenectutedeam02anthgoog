referring to the restoration of Cicero's house, and made it a handle
for a fresh attack upon him. Cicero replied in the speech De Ha-
ruspicum Responsis. By this time, Pompey and Clodius had found
it convenient to make common cause with each other. A fresh
attack, which Clodius soon after made on Cicero's house, was re-
pulsed by Milo. With the assistance of the latter, also, Cicer0,
after being once foiled in his attempt by Clodius and his brother,
succeeded, during the absence of Clodius, in carrying off from the
Capitol the tablets on which the laws of the latter were engraved.

Clodius actively supported Pompey and Crassus when they be-
came candidates for the consulship, to which they were elected in
the beginning of B.C. 55, and nearly lost bis life in doing so. He
appears to have been, in a great measure, led by the hope of being
appointed on an embassy to Asia, which would give him the oppor-
tunity of recruiting his almost exhausted pecuniary resources, and
getting from Brogitarus, and some others whom he had assisted, the
rewards they had promised him for his services. It appears, how-
ever, that he remained in Rome. We hear nothing more of him
this year. In B.C. 54, we find him prosecuting the ex-tribune Pro-
cilius, who, among other acts of violence, was charged with mur-
der; and, soon atter, we find Clodius and Cicero, with four others,
appearing to defend M. AEmilius Scaurus. Yet it appears that
Cicero still regarded him with the greatest apprehension. (Cia, ad
Ata, iv„ 153 ad Q. Fr„ ii., 15, b.,· iii., 1, 4.)

In B.C. 53, Clodius was a candidate for the proetorship‚ and Milo
for the consulship. Each strove to hindei· the election of the other.
,They collected armed bands of slaves and gladiators‚ and the streets
of Rome became the scene os fresh tumults and stays, in one of
which Cicero himself was endangered. When the consuls endeav-
ored to hold the comitia, Clodius fell upon them with his band, and
one of them, Cn. Domitius, was woundcd. The senate met to de-
liberate. Clodius spoke, and attacked Cicero and Milo, touching‚
among other things, upon the amount of debt with which the latter
was burdened. Cicero replied in the speech De AEre Alieno Milonis.
, The contest, however, was soon after brought to a sudden and vio-
lent end. On the twentieth os January‚ B.C. 52, Milo set out on a

· journey to Lanuvium. Near Bovillae he met Clodius, who was re-

turning to Rome aster visiting some of his property. Both were
accompanied by armed followers, but Milo's party was the stronger.
The two antagonists had passed each other without disturbance ς
but two os the gladiatore in the rear of Milo’s troop picked a quarrel
with some of the followers of Clodius, who immediately turned
