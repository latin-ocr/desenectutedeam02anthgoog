guinary scene ς and from the language of the text, ⁴⁴ propter recentem
poencm T. Gracchi? his ‘life appears to have been spared merely
because the pedple were so irritated by the recent murder of Tibe-
rius Gracchus, that the putting to death os another tribune might
have exasperated them beyond all endurance.

De Gaii Graecia autem tribunatu, ἀο. “ What, however, 1 have
reason to expect from the tribuneship os Caius Gracchus (whenever
it does come), I do not like ιο conjecture.'’ Laelius refers to the
future tribuneship of Caius, which he takes for granted will come
as soon as he is of the legal age for obtaining it (since he was as
yet too young for the office), and he purposely closes his eyes on
the visions os evil which he thinks he sees in the distance. The
present conversation is supposed to have taken place in Rc. 129,
and Caius Gracchus did not become tribune until Rc. 123.—Serpit
enim deinde res, dcc. ‘⁴ For, ever since (that last affair), a thing is
creeping on silently (among us), which, now that it has once begun
to exist, keeps gliding onward for fatal mischief with more and more
of a downward tendency.” Deinde refers to the agrarian commo·
tions in the time os Tiberius Gracchus, and res to what Laelius con-
siders the democratic and leveling spirit connected with those dis-
turbances, and which, though partially checked for a time by the vi-
olence of the aristocracy, waS, nevertheless, gaining ground agam.
Seyffert, less correctly, refers res ιο the Lex Papiria de jubendis legi-
bus, διο.

Videtis in tabella jam ante, dcc. “You see how great a plague-
spot was produced already before this in the case os the ballot,” i. e.,
by the two leges tabellariae, the Gabinian and Cassian, both os which
preceded the tribuneship os Tiberine, the Gabinian law having been
passed B.C. 139, and the Cassian in B.C. 137, while the tribuneship
os Tiberius was in Rc, 133. Hence the expression jam ante in the
text. The complaint of Laelius is dictated by an aristocratic spirit,
since the laws establisbing voting by ballot (leges tabellarioe) proved,
in fact, a strong saseguard against the encroachments of the patri-
ciana—Videre jam videor. ‘⁴ Methinks Ι already see.'’—-Plures enim
discent, διο. He means that there will be a greater number of tur-
bulent tribunes to tread in the footsteps of Gracchus, than of spirited
senators ιο resist them.

case of the republic.’' A much better reading than in rempublicam.
