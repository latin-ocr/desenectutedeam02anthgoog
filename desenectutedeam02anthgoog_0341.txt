iards thssn his avaricious general, Lucullus, was able ιο acquire.
(Appiam, vi„ 54.) The year following, 150 B.c., Scipio was sent
by Lucullus to Africa, to request Masinissa ιο send a number os
elephante over to Spain. He was most honorably. received. Mas-
inissa and the Carthaginians were just preparing for battle ; Scipio
beheld the contest from an eminence3 and as soon as the Cartha·
ginians were apprised of his presence, they entreated him ιο act as
mediator between them and Masinissa. But he was not able ιο et?-
fect what they wished, and he returned to Spain with the elephanta.
(Appias, viii„ 71, dte.)-

When the war between Carthago and Rome hroke out, Scipio,
then still military tribune, went to Africa, and here, again, distin-
guished himself so much by his courage, prudence, and justice, that
he not only gained the unlimited confidence of his own countrymen
and Masinissa, but even of the Carthaginians, who trusted no Ro-
man but Scipio. Roman ambassadors, who were sent to the camp
in Africa ιο report on the state of affairs, on their return to Rome

w'ere unbounded in their· praise os Scipio and of the attachment of '

the soldiers to him. (Appian, viii„ 98, dte.) In 148 B.C., when
the consul Calpurnius Piso undertook the command in Africa,
Scipio returned to Rome, where every body appears to have been
convinced that he alone was able to complete the conquest of Car-
thage. Cato said that Scipio alone was alive, while all the other
generals were mere shadows. (Lim, Epir„ 49 ;¹ Polyb„ mvi, 6.)
The consul Piso made very little progress in Africa, and, when
Scipio was a candidate for the aedileship, hs was unanimously elect-
ed consul {or the year 14⁷ B.0., though lie had not yet attained the
legitimate age ε he obtained Africa for his province. On his return
ιο Africa he ‘was accompanied by Polybius and Laelius 3 and imme·
diately aster his arrival he saved a considerable body of Roman
soldiers‚ who had penetrated into one of the suburbs of Carthage.
(Appian, viii„ 113, etc.) He restored discipline in the Roman army.
His first operation was to cut off all supplies, which the carthagin-
ians had hitherto received from the interior os Africa, and in the
following winter (147—146 Ro.) he succeeded in taking Nepheris,
whence the Cmtha’ginians, till then, had received their supplies by
sea. His command of the army was prolonged for the year 146
Bc, and in the spring of this year he made his attack upon the
city, which was defended with the utmost despair, and by—a decree
of the senate he razed it ιο the ground. He is said to have wept
over its ruins, and to have uttered the prophetie words of Homer,
as applicable to his own native city (IL, vi„ 448, seq.):
