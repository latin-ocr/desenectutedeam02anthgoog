CHAPTER. VII.

o 21.

At memoria minuitur. ‘⁴ But (some one will say) the memory is
impaired (by old age).’‘—Tardior. ‘⁴ More dull (than ordinary).”
Equivalent to tardioris ingenii, of a duller intellect than we ordina-
eily find among men.-—Perceperat. ‘⁴ Had acquired.” Observe that
' percipere is here equivalent to animo et memoria comprehendere.
(Sckfitz, Lex. cic„ ε. v.)—-Lysimachum salutare solitum. ‘⁶ Was ac-
customed to greet as Lysimachus‚'' i. e.‚ to salute him when they
met by some name pot his own. Supply esse after solitum. As-re-
gards the powers osmemory possessed by Themistocles, consult Cic„
Acad„ ii., 1 ; Val. Max„ viii, 7, 15.—Qui eunt. Supply in vinis, if
any ellipsis be actually supposed to exist here.

Nec sepulcra legens, ὄιο. It was a prevailing superstition among
the ancients, that to read the in'scriptions on the monuments of the
dead weakened or quite destroyed the memory. (Compare Cic„ de
Pin„ v., l, 3 ς Plane„ Tmo„ i., 2, 62.) Α notion somewhat similar
-to this prevailed among the Jews, who believed that to look upon
the sace of a dead person was >destructive οἱ the memory. (Bmorf'e
Customs and ceremoniae of tlte Jews, in Stekelin’e Rabbinical Liter-
ature, ii., p. 359.)---ιῩαάὶηιοπίςν constituta. “Their appointed recog-
nizances,’' i. e., the recognizances -into which they have entered,
and by which they bind themselves to appear in court on a day ap-
pointed therein. 11· the individual so bound did not appear, he was
said vadimonium deserere, and lost his cause by default (oausam per-
debat. Compare Orat. pro Quincti„ e. 18, and Hor„ Sat„ i., 9, 36).

ᾴ 22.

Quid jurisconsulti, διο. “How stands the case with old men who
are lawyers,” dcc. The profession of the ancient lawyer, like that
of the orator, especially required the cultivation of the memory.
, For a literal translation supply faciunt, and observe the change os
punctuation which we have introduced in accordance with the sug-
gestion of Nauck, namely, a comma, instead os a mark of interro-

gation, after jurisconsulti, pontifices, and augures. The term tenea ,

belongs to each of these words, a meaning, however, which is ob-
scured, if not altogether destroyed, by the common mode of pointing.

Modo. “Provided only,’' Put for dummodo—Honorati& The
reference is to individuals who enjoy public honors, that is, who fill
public cilices, duc. Compare the explanation os Faceiolati: “qui
honoribus funguntur et magistratus gerunt‚'’ and consult Brut, 81,
