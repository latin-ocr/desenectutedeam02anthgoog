Gratissimum nobis, dcc. ⁸⁴ Yon will have done a very acceptable
service to both of us, that 1 may answer sor Scipio also.” As Loelius
was the elder, his age gave him this privilege. Thus we have in
the “De Amicitia” (c. 9) the following language from Fannius:
‘⁸ Tu vero perge, Lali5 pro hoc enim, qui minor est natu, meo jure re·
epmzdeofl—Volumus quidem certe. “We wish, indeed, at least.”
Observa that volumus has here the force os desideramus—Ingraves-
ceneom atatem. ‘⁴ The weight os increasing years,” i. e., old age as
it comes on. Literally‚ “ age beginning to grew heavy.”—Si sutu-
rum est.. ‘⁴ Since it is going to prove.‘'—Quam nobis qnoque ing-redi-
endum sit. ‘⁶ On which we also may have to enter.” The more
usual form os construction would be quoe nobis quoque ingredienda
eit5 the present use os the gerund, however, occurs also in Varro
(R. R„ iii„ 3, 9, 18) z ‘⁴ Objiciendum pullis polentam‚” as well as else-
where. (Oonsult Sam-tii Μίνωι, iii, 8, and the note of Perizonius p
and also scalibatum, ad Rada„ ii., p. 251, n. 59.) Some editions
read qua here instead of quanm· Cicero, however, says, viam or in
viam ingredi, not vim—Istuc. For istoc, from istic, istoec, istoc, or
ictuc. Not the adverb.

Ue potero. “Ae well as 1 shall be &lest—Mamm (equalium.
“Of my companions in years,’‘ i. e.‚ of men of my own years.— ·
Pares autent, vetere proverbio, dcc. ‘⁴ Like, you knoW, according to
the old saying, congregate most easily with like.” This is the
same as our common English expression, ‘⁴ Birds of a feather flock
together.”, ”Compare Aristotle (Em, 8, 1), Ὅθεν τὸν ὅμοιόν φασιν
ὦς ὅμοιον, καὶ κολοιὸν ποτὶ κολοιόν, and Plato (ἣμεροι, c. 18, 3), Ὀ
παλαιὸς λόγος εὖ ἔχει, ὡς ὅμοιον ὁμοίῳ ἀεὶ πελάζει-ΨΦ C'. Salina-
tor, dre. ‘⁴ (And listened to the things) which Caius Salinator, δια,
were accustomed to deplore.’' Observe here the anacoluthon, quc
being the relative to querelis in thought merely, not in grammatical
connection, so that it is the same as saying ιαμ interfui querelis et
audivi quoe, duc. Compare Ep. ad Diu„ ii., 8, 2: ‘⁴ Semonibus quoe
nec possunt scribi ‘nec scribenda sunt-’³ Some of the MSS. have quas
C. Salinator, quas Sp. Albinus, of which Beier (ad Offi, ii., p. 150,
365) and Hermann both approve3 but we have preferred allowing
the ordinary text to remain anchanged. ⁵
