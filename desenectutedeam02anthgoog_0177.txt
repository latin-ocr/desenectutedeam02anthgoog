Roman jul-ist, and particularly celebrated for his work on the Twelve
Tables, entitled Tripartita, or Jus Elianum. He was consul B.C.

-198, with -'1·. Quinctius Flamininus. Ennius compliments him in ’

the well-known line quoted by Cicero (de Orat„ 1., 45), “ Egregie
cordatus homo Catus AEliu' Sexta-est —— Ti. Coruncanius. Tiberius
Coruncanius, the celebrated jurist, already mentioned in chap. vi.,

jurist‚ and distinguished, also, sor his knowledge of the pontifical
lavv. He was consul with C. Cassius Longinus, Rc. 171, and
twenty-one years before the death of Cato. Hence the terni modo,
‘⁴ of late‚” in the text, which shows that he must not be consountled
with P. Licinius Cressae, who was consul with the elder AfricanuS,
B.C. 205. (Consult Cor-rad„ Qua-st. Min„ p. 313, and Gernlaeard, affl
loc.)—Jura prescribebantur. “ The laws were expounded,” i. e., legal
advice was accustomed to be given. Compare Wetzel (Iud. Laz„
ε, v.): “ a me praescribuntur ,iura civibuS, ich zeichne meinen Mit-
bz‘crger‘n die Rechts vor, gabe ihnen cine Anwcisung wie sie sich
bei Rech<sfiillen verhalten sollen.’'—Quorum est provecta prudentia.
⁴⁴ Whose professional acquirements were carried onward.” Equiv-
alent to ‘⁴ quorum juris civilis et augurii scicntia progressus fecit, or
increvit.”

general, that musical distinctness of utterance (peculiar to the ora-

neuter adjective sor the noun, namely, canorum illud for cantus ill⁶3
anm-with regard to the expression itself, compare Orat„ 18: “ Est
in dicendo etiam quidam cantus obscurior? &ce-Annos. ‘⁶ My pres-

cst, διο. “ But, (even is this musical distinctness be lost‚) still the
enunciation of one advanced in years is gracesul, calm, and sub-
dued.’' Observe the limiting effect of sed tamen aster a general as-

' sertion ,expressed by omnino, and compare the explanation os Fac-

ciolati: ‘⁴ Sed, utcunque canorum illud amittatur, tamen,” dcc. There
is, therefore, an admission in sed tamen that the canorum illud may
be lost by age.-Ip³a. “Of itsels.”—Comta. ‘⁴ Neat,” i. e., well

by εὐσῦνθετος.
