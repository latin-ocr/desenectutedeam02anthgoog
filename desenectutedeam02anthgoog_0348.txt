min the year 1471, a quarto volume issued from the press os Jen·

eon, at Venice, entitled AEmilii Probi de Vita Euellendum, contain-
ing biographies of twenty distinguished commanders, nineteen
Greek and one Persian. Next came three chapters headed De Regi-

bus, presenting very brief notices os certain famous kings os Persia “

and Macedonia, os the elder Sicilian Dionysius, and-some os the
more remarkable among the successors os Alexander. The volume

concluded with a biography os Hamilcar, and abiography of Han- «

nibal. A prefaee, or introduction, to the lives commenccd with the
words, “Non dubito fore plerosque, Attice, qui Itoc genua scripture
leve, et non satis dignum summorum virorum judicent ;” and prefixed
to the whole was a dedication, in verse, to the Emperor Theodosius,
in which we find the couplet,

Si rogat Auctorem, paulatim detege nostrum
Tunc Domino nomen, me sciat esse Probum.

A second edition, in quarto, of the same book, without date, was
printed at Venice by Bernardinus Venetus. In this a biography of
Cato ιε added. The title in one part os the volume is AEmilii Proln‘¹
Histoi-ici excellentium Imperatorum Vitem in another, AEmilii Probi de
Virorum Illustrium Vita. A third edition, in quarto, without date,-
and without name os place or printer, but known to belong to Milan,
and to be not later than 1496, was published as AEmilius Probus de
Viris Illustribu23 and here we have not only the biography os Cato,
but a life of Atticus also. Numerone impressione appearedduring
the next half century, varying from the above and from each other
in no important particular, except that in the strasburg one of 1506
the lise-of Atticus is ascribed to Cornelius Nepos, a point in which
it is supported by many MSS. But in 1569 a great sensation was
produced among the learned by the edition os the celebrated Dionys-
ius Lambinus (4to, Paris, 1669), who not only revised the text with

,much care, but strenuously maintained that the whole work was
the production of that Cornelius Nepos who flourished toward the-
close os the Roman republic, and not of an unknown AEmilius Pro-
bus living at the end of the 4th century. The arguments upon
which he chiefly insisted were:

1. The extreme purity of the Latinity, and the chaete simplicity
of the style, which exhibit a striking contrast to the semi· barbarian
jai-gon and meretricious finery of the later empire Every critical
scholar must feel the weight of this observation. .
