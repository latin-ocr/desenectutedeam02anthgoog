qu'aest'm G. Cassius Longinus (asterward one or Coesar‘s murderers)
and the legate Octavium but he did not profit by their advice. He
was quite uninsormed as to the chara‘cter and resources of the ene·
my he was going to attack; sancied that he should have 'an easy
conquest over unwarlike people 3 that countless treasures lay before
him, and that it would be a matter of no difficulty to outstrip the
glory os his predecessore, Scipio, Lucullus, Pompey, and push on
his army to Bactria and India. ’ He did not attempt to take advant-
age of the intestine dissensione in Parthia 3 did not form any cord-
ial union with the Armeniam and other tribes who were hostile to
the Parthians, and did not obtain correct information'as to the posi· ·
tiones the enemy's force and the nature of the country. On the
contrary, he listened to flatterers; he suffered himself to be grossly ·
deceived and misled‚ and he alienated, by ill-treatment and inso-
lence, those who might have been useful and were disposed to be

friendly. Aiter crossing· the Euphrates, and taking Zenodotium, in .

Mesopotamia (a success on which he prided himself as is it were a
great exploit), he did not follow up the attack upon Parthia, but
gave time to the enemy to assemble his forces, and concert his plens

and choose his ground. He was advised by Cassius to kee'p the ‘

banks of the Euphrates, to make himself master of Seleucia (which
was situate on a canai connecting the Euphrates and the Tigris),
and to take Babylon, since both these cities were always at eumity
with the Parthians. He chose, however, aster leaving seven thou·
sand infantry and one thousand 'cavalry in garrison in Mesopotamia,
to reci-oss the Euphrates with the rest'of his forces, and to pass the
winter in Northern Syria. In Syria he behaved more like a rev·
enue officer than a general. He omitted to muster and exer-eise
the troops, or to review the armor and military stores. It is true
th’at he ordered the neighboring tribes and chiestains to mrnish re··
cruits and bring supplies, but these requisitione he willingly com·
muted ‘for money. Nor was his cupidity 'satisfied by such gains:
At Hierapolis there was a w'ealthy temple, dedicated to the Syrien -
goddess, Derceto or Atargatis (the Ashtaroth of scripture ), ,who pre.
sided over the elementa of nature and the productive seeds ot·
things. (Plin,H.N.,v.,19; Strab„xvi.,infin) This temple he'
plundered of its treasures, which it took several days to examine·
and weigh. One of the ill omens mentioned by Plutarch occurred
here. Crassus had a son, Publius, who had lately arrived t‘rom
Italy, with one thousand Gallie cavalry, to joiu his father’ s army:
The eon, on going out ot· the temple, stnmbled on the threshold, and
