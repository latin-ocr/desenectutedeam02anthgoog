280 Excessus 1.⁸

Toward the close of B.C. 62, Clodius was guilty of an act 01· sac-
rilege which is especially memorable‚ as it gave rise to that deadly
animosity between him and Cicero, which produced such important
consequences to both and to Rome. · The mysteries of the Bona

· Dea were this year celebrated in the house of Caesar. Clodius, who

had an intrigue with Pompeia, Caesar’s wife, entered the house,

with the assistance of one of the attendants, disguised as a female ·

musician. But while his guide was gone to apprize her mistress,
Clodius was detected by his voice. The alarm was immediately
given, but he made his escape by the aid of the damsel who had
introduced him. He was already a candidate for the quaestorship,
and was elected ; but in the beginning of B.C. 61, before he set out
for his province, he was impeached for this offence. The senate
referred the matter to the pontifices, who deelared it an act of im·
piety. Under the direction of the senate a rogation was proposed
to the people, to the effect that Clodius should be tried by judices,
selected by the praetor, who was to preside. The assembly, how-
. ever, was broken up without coming to a decision. The senate
was at. first disposed to persist in its original plan; but afterward‚
on the recommendation of Hortensius, the proposition os the tribune
Fufius Calenus was adopted, in accordance with whieh the judices
were to be selected from the three decuries. Cicem, who had hith-
erto strenuously supported the senate, now relaxed in his exertions.
Clodius attempted to prove an alibi, but Cicero’s evidence showed

that 110 was with him in Rome only three hours* before he pretended .

to have been at Interamna. Bribery and intimidation, however,
secured him an acquittal, by a majority of thirty-one to twenty-five.

Cicer0, however, who had been iri-itated by some sarcastic allusions -

, made by Clodius to his consulship, and by a verdict given 111 0011-
tradiction to his testimony, attacked Clodius and his partisans in
the senate with great vehemence. ⁸

Soon aster his acquittal, Clodius went to his province, Sicily, and
intimated his design of becoming a candidate sor the oedileship. On
his return, however, he disclosed a different purpose„ Eager to re-
venge himself on Cicero, that he might be 111-111011 with more formi-
dable power, he purposed becoming a tribune of the pl'ebs. For this
it was necessary that he should be adopted into a plebeian family ;
and as he was not in the power of his parent, the adoption had to
take place by a vote of the people in the Comitia Curiata. 1110110111-
ed attempts were made by the tribune C. Herennius to get this
brought about. Cicero, who placed reliance 011 the friendship and
, support of Pompey, did not spare Clodius, though he at times shows
