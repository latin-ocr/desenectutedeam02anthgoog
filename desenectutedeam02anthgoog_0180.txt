from that island tp Africa—Conna in Hispania. Cato obtained
the consulship in Rc. 195, when thirty-nine years old, and obtained

Hither Spain sor his province. In his Spanish campaign he exhih- ’

ited military genius of a very high order.— Tribunus militaris.
Cicero is supposed by many to have made a slight mistake here.
since, according to Livy (xxxvi, 17), Cato was on this occasion a
consular legatus, and since, as they affirm, no one was ever made
tribune os the soldiers aster having filled the office os consul. To
this last assertion‚ however, a direct contradiction has been given,
founded on several passages of Livy (xlii, 49; xliv„ 1 ; xxii, 49),
and one of Plutarch (Vis. Flamin„ c. 20); so that the point may be

os Carthage.-Non rostra. Aster his censorship‚ the public lise of

Ι Cato was spent chiefly in sorensic contests, senatorial debatezr, and

speeches to the people. In the very last year of his life he took a
conspicuous part in the righteous, but unsuccessful, prosecution of
S. Sulpicius Galba, for his flagrant breach os saith toward the Lusi·
tani. Cato made a powerful speech on this occasion against Galba,
and inserted it in the seventh book os his Origines, a few days or
months before his death. (Cia, Brutus, 23)- Clientes. consult

Mature fieri senem, dic. ‘⁴ Το become an old man soon, is you
wish to be an old man long.” The true meaning os the proverb is
that, if we wish to lead a long life, we should acquire and practice
in our youth those virtues which are more generally observed in
old men, namely, moderatim, temperance, dcc„ and, viewed in this
