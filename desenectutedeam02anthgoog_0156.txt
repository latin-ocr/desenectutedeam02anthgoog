enjoy.'’ By opes is here meant influence or cmdit in the state ς by
copias, on the contrary, private resources. Plutarch describes these
last as very extensive. ⁸⁸When,” he observes, “Cato’s desire os
wea'lth increased, and he found agriculture rather amusing than
profitable, ‘he turned his thoughts to surer dependences, and em-
ployed his money in purchasing ponde, hot· haths, places proper sor
sollers, and estates in good condition having pasture-ground and
wood- lauds. From these he derived a great revenue, ‘such a one,’
he used to say, ‘as Jupiter himself could not disappoiut him of.”

Est ictuc quidem, Laeli, aliquid, dte. “There is something, 1 ad-
mit, Laelius, in what you say, but it by uo means covern the whole
ground.'’ Literally, “That remark of yours, Laelius, is indeed some-
thing; but all things are by no means contained in that.” Observe
here the usual employment of iste to indicate what appertains to
the person spoken to. (Zumpt, 4 12⁷.)-Seriplaio cuidam. “ To a
certain native of Seriphos.” This was a small and unimportaut
island iu the AEgean Sea, south os cythnos, and now called Serpho.
lt is known in mythology as the island to which the ark, or coffer,
containing Danae aud her infant son Perseus, wae carried. The
insignificance of the island os Seriphos caused its name to pasc into
a. proverb. (Compare Cic„ N. D., 1, 313 Aristoph„ Aeliam„ 541,
aud the scholiast ad loe.) The story related in the text is taken
from Plato (Rep, i., p. 329, Ε.), and is related also by Plutarch (Vir.
nemin„ c. 18).

Nee hercule inquit, ἁο. The point of this reply is sometimes mis-
understood or not fully perceived. The meaning of Tbemistocles
is this: ‘⁶ You say right, 1 do owe much to my country, and so much,
in fact, that, if I had been born iu Seriphos, I would never leave be-
come celebrated. At the same time, however, Ι can assure you that
Ι do not owe all to my country. You, however, are so thoroughly
contemptible in youreelf (setting your insignificaut country out os the
question), that, had you been born even at Athens, you would never
have attained celebrity ‘ all.” In this way he attacks not only the
meanuess of the man·s15native island, but the mean spirit and stu-
pidity of the individual imsels. (Compare Wetzel, cd loc.)—Nobili³
. . . clarus. Plutarch, in relating the story, employa the term ἐνδο-
ξος, · Plato, however, has the more expressive ὀνομαστός, which
comprehends both‘ nobilitatem gener-ien and‘ ‘claritudinem saeto-

rum‚' ’and which Cicero, therefore, expresses here by both nobilis
and clarus (Gemhard, ad 1oe )
