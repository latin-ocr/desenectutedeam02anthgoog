Joyments.-Et ii docti. “And these learned men.” As, for exam·
ple, Hegesias of Cyrene, on the coast of Northern Africa, who took
a very gloomy view of human life, and wrote a book called ἀποκαρε
repon», in which a man, who had resolved to starve himself, was in-

the next life will partly arise, not only from a renewal -of those vir-
tuous connections which have been formed in the present one, but
from couversing at large with the whole glorious assembly of the
great and good—Ex hac turba et colluvione. ‘⁴ From this crowd and

employments of humanity.—- Catonem meum. His son, M. Porcius

Quod contra. “Whereas, on the contrary. ’⁷ Literally‚‘ ‘contrary
to which.” Observe the anastrophe, and consult ngelsbach, Latein.
stilistik, p. 367. Nauck, however, maintains‚ though certainly with
less correctnes8‚ that the true construction is contra decuit. (Neue
