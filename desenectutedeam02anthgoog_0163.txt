Hi consules. ‘⁸ The present consuls,'’ i. ι., the consuls for A.U.C.
604, Rc. lost—T. Flamininus et Μ’. Acilius. The full names were
T. Quinctius Flamininus and Μ’. Acilius Bulbus—Cepione, et Plu·-
lippo iemm, consualibus. Quintus Marcius Philippus was consul for
the second time, and had for his colleague Gneus Servilius Coepio,
in ΑΒΕ. 585, Rc. 169. Cato, who was born Ro. 234, would
therefore be, as stated in the text, 65 years old at the time of En·
nius's death; while Scipio would be, at the same time, about 17
years old, and Lae'lius a few years niden-Legem Voconiam magna
voce, dcc. ‘⁴ Had advocated the Voconian law with a loud voice,
and with good lungs.‘’ Literally, “and with good (strength os)
sides.‘' From various passages iu cicere, and other a'ncient writ-
ers, we find that strength of sides as well as voice was absolutely,
required in an orator3 for they very properly used the word siden
as we do lunge, since the lungs have in themselves no manner of
soree, but their whole motion depende on the muscles os the sides
and breast. (Franklin, ad loc.) The verb madeo is the technical
one employed to express the advocating. or recommending the pas-
sage of a law, (Compare Brut„ 23, 89; Βία, xlv„ 21.) The Vo-
conian law was named aster its proposer, Q.0Voconius Saxa, a trib-
une of the commone. For an account of its provisions, consult
Dict. Ant„ p. 1064, 8vo ed., and p. 200, 12mo ed.

Paupertatem. The reference is not to actual indigenoe‚ but mere-
ly to humble and contracted means, the true force os paupertas.
Ennius dwelt in a small abode on the Aventino Hill, att-ended by a
single female slave, and, though be might have obtained liberal aid
from the Scipios and other noble friends, preferred maintaining
himself in honorable poverty by acting as a preceptor to patrician
youths. After having lived happily to a good old age, he was car-
ried off by a disease of the joints, most probably gout.

Etenim. ‘⁴ And (well may Ι say this of him) for-’⁹ Observe here
the elliptical use of etenim, which term answers, therefore, to the
Greek καῖ γάρ, and compare the explanation os Beier (ad Off, iii„
15, 63; t. ii., p. 1297), as cited by Binerbeck: ‘⁴ Ennius senectute
paene oblectabatur. Et recte quidem: injustoe enim aum causa cur.
senectus misera videatur.”—-Gdntemplor animo. The verb contemplor
properly applies, as Festus remarks, to an augur making observa-
tione in the heavens. When it has, as in the present instance, a
