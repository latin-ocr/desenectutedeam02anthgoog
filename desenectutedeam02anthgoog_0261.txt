§ 75.

Impediat magnas utilitates amicorum. ‘⁸ May prove prejudicial to
important interests of our friends,’' i. e., may prove extremely pre·
judicial to their interests. — Trojam Neoptolemus capere potuisset.
According to the legend, it had been prophesied by Helenus that
Neoptolemus„ otherwise called Pyrrhus, the son of Achilles, and
Philoctetes with the arrows of Hercules, were necessary for the
taking of Troy. (Sepla, Phil„ 115.) Lycomedes, king of Scyros,
the maternal grandfather of the young warrior, wished to prevent
him from going to the Trojan war. Lange and Ernesti find a diffi-

‘ culty here, since what is stated in the present passage respecting
Neoptolemus, ie, as these critics maintain, said elsewhere os Achil-

les. The objection‚ however, is a seeble one, inasmuch as the pres-
ence of·both father and son was necessary sor the capture of the city.
(Compare Wetzel, ad loc.)—Iter suum. His journey to Troy aster

the death of Achilles—Magna res. “‚Important occasions.''— Ut
discedendum sit ab amicis. ‘⁶ So that a separation from one another

by friends becomes necessary.”-Deeiderium. ‘⁶ The absence of the
other.”--Infir⁷nus mollisque. “ Weak and unmanly.”

Quasi quaedam calamitas. “ A kind of calamity, as it were.” Ob·
serve that quasi is here added, because calamitas properly denotep
a storm that lays low the stalks (calami) os corn—In dimittendis.
“In renouncing.”—Ad vulgares amicitias. “ To ordinary friend-
ships,‘’ i. a, to that lower species of friendships which occur in the
ordinary intercourse of the world. Itis in these alone that such a
“calamitas‘’ can occur, since the nobler alliances of the wise and
good admit no rupture of the kind. Hence the peculiar force of
enim at the beginning of the clause, and also of the expression oratio

nostra delabitur.—Remissione usus. ‘⁶ By a gradual cessation os in-
timacy.’'-—Dissuendoe magis quam discindendae. ‘⁶ To be unstitched

rather than cut asunder‚” i. e., are to be dropped gradually rather
than broken off suddenly.
