EXOURSUS Ι.

LIFEs AND CHARACTER. OF CLODIUS.²

P. Cromna Puncnsn was the youngest son os Appius Claudius
Pulcher, who in Rc. 82 marched with Sulla against Rome: and
met his death near the city. (Pium, Vit. Sul„ 29.) The form of
the name Clodius was not peculiar to him; it is occasionally found
in the case os others os the gens (Orelli, Inscript„ 579); and Clo-
dius was himself sometimes called Claudius. (Dio Casa, xxxv„
14.) He first makes hisgappearance in history in B.C. 70, serving
with his brother Appius under his brother-in-law, 1.. Lucullus, in
Asia. Displeased at not being treated by Lucullus with the dis·
tinction he had expected, he encouraged the soldiers to mutiny.

He then lest Lucullus, and betook himself to his other brother-in-
* laW, Q. Marcius-Rex, at that time proconsul in Cilicia, and was iffi
trusted by him with the command of the fieet. He sell into the
hands of the pirates, who, however, dismissed him without ransom,
through sear of Pompey. He next went to Antiochia, and joined
the Syrians in making war against the Arabiane. Here, again, he

·’ ' excited some of the soldiers to mutiny, and nearly lost his life. He

now returned to Rome, and made his first appearance in civil affairs
in Bc. 65, by impeaching Catiline for extortion in his government
of Africa. Catiline, however, bribed his accuser and judge, and
escaped.

In Rc, 64, Clodius accompanied the proproetor L. Muraena to
Gallia Transalpina, where he resorted to the most nefarious meth-
ods of procuritig money. His avarice, or, the want to which his
dissipation had reduced him, led him to have recourse tovsimilar
proceedings on his return to Rome. Asconius (in Mil„ p. 50, orell.)
says that Cicero often charged him with having taken part in the
conspiracy of Catiline; but, with the exception of some probably
exaggerated rhetorical allusione (De Har-usp. Resp„ 3; pro Mil„
14), no intimation of the kind appears in Cicero, and Plutarch (Vit.
Cic„ 29) says that on that occasion he took the side of the consul,
and was still on good terms with him.
