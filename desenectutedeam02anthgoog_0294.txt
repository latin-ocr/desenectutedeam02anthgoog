Manius Curius. Compare De Seneca, xvi„ 55.--Usum. “who
has enjoyed72-3arbaeutos mullos exceptantem, &c ‘⁶ Taking from
the fish-pond and handling the bearded mullcts.” The fish here

meant is the red mullet (Mullus barbatus, Lirin), celebrated sor its ,

flavor, and for the high estimation in which it was held by the Ro- ·
man epicures, who were in the habit, according to Varro, os pre·
serving it in artificial waters, aione of the most convincing prooss
os their individual wealth. They were accustomed to seed it
· from the hand, end took great delight, also, in watehing over the
fish while dying, as the bright red color of its healthy state passed
through various :hedes os purple, violet, bloish, and white, while
- lise was gradually receding. (Seme, Quoest„ iii„ 17.) So extrava-
gant was the solly os the Romans with regard to this fish, that they
osten gave for them immense prices. Martia! mentions one of four
pounds weight, which had eost thirteen hundred sesterces (x., 31,
3) ;' and, according to Suetonius, three mullets were sold in the
time os Tiberius sor thirty thousand sesterces- (Suet, Tib.. 34.)
Pliny (H. Ν., ix„ 17, 31) says that one was sold under Caligula
for eight thousand. (Gnffiek’s Crevier, vol. x., p. 277.)-Muroena·
rum. »The murana, or ‘⁴ lamprey,” is a species of eel (Murena
Helena, Lina), The Linnaeun name has arisen from the remark

The muraenae were carefully reared hy the Romans in their fish·
ponds, and were held in high estimation not only on account os
their ssavor, but also because they were taught to come at the

sound os their master's voice and seed from his hand. (Mau-tid, x.‚
