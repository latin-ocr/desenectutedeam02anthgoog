existence—Honesta. ⁴⁴ An honorable Μεθ’-Θώρηκα nmmum- '
que. “The best and greatest thing that we can enjoy.” The ref-
erence is to vita beata—3130? experiri. ‘⁶ To make trial of them.”

Cum judicaveris, dcc. The rule here referred to is, that we should
never suffer affection to take root in our hearts before judgment has
had time to interpose her eslmer counsels.—Nbgligentia plectimur.
‘⁶ We are punished for our negligence,” i. e., we sorbeat to deliber-
ate until deliberation becomes of no avail. Eqniv‘alent to negligen-
tioe poenam damna-Tum maxime. ‘⁸ So especially are πον Sup-
ply plectimur.—Proeposteris em'm utimur, &c ‘⁶ For we adopt, in

· such cases, plans of “action having that last which ought to have

been first, and we proceed to do things which ought to have been
done long before.” Literally, ‘⁸ we do things already done ;” but
the literal meaning requires to be dropped here, and a freer one snb·-
stitnted. Compare the explanation of Pacciolati: “facimus postea
¹ qued faciendum erat prius ,·” and that of wetzel: “thuri wellen, wne
man sehon lange hatte chun sollenff’ The expression actum agere has
reference, originally, to legal operatione, and, according to Dona·
tus (ad Terent„ Adelph„ ii„ 2, 24), relates, properly, to one who
attempta to bring up a matter for judieial investigation ‘which has
already been decided-——Implicati ultro et citro. ‘⁸ Aster having been
ι united on both sides.” Uter-alh, ‘⁴ on this side and on that.”

Quamquam ι midae, ὰο. Facciolati conjectures namque for quam-
quam. which Manutius and Graevius even admit into the text. Au
the MSS„ however, give quamquam, and the whole difficulty will dis-
sppear if we merely connect this latter term more closely with
what-precedes, than is done in most editione, which make a new
sentence commoneo with quamquam, instead of placing merely a
colon aster ementium. As virtue forms the basis of true friendship,
one would imagine that there would also be an undivided opinion
in relation to this qualityfbut it will be found upon examination that
friendship alone enjoys this distinction.-V0nditatio quadam. ‘⁴ A
kind of idle parade.” Venditatio properly denotes a setting off or
recommending os a thing intended for sale, and then, generally,
'any specious display or idle parade—Tenuis victus cultusque. ‘⁴ A
&agal table and a plain mode of life.’'-- Ut nihil inanius, dcc. Be·
