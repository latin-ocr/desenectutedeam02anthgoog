After he h‘ad made· the necessary arrangements ln Africa, and
annihilated an enemy νικος though humbled, was still looked upon

by Rome with jeslousy, scipio returned to Italy, and entered Rome
in triumph. In 142 Bc. he was censor with L. Mammiae, and at
this time of increasing luxury he fulmodthe duties of his office
with the greatest strictness, and without any respect to person or
rank. In the lustrum which he performed at the close of his cen-
sus, he did not pray, as had been customary before, for the increase
of the republic, but only for its preservationi. (Val. Max„ iv„ -1,
10.) lt was, probably, aster his censorship that he, together with
Sp. Mummius and L. Metellus, travelled through Egypt, Syria, Asia,
and Greece, to look into the state of affairs in those countries.

The war against Numantia, in Spain, hed been carried on for a
long time without success; Scipio was considered the only man
who could bring it to a termination, and, although absent at the time
of the electione, he was made consul for the year 1:34 Rc. On hie

sur-vivers were selected by Scipio to ndum his triumph; the rest
were sold as slaves, and the city ,was raaed to the ground. (Appiae,

While Scipio was engaged in the siege of Numantia, the Grac-
? chien disturbant-,es began at Rome. Although his wife, Sempronia,
vae a sister of the Gracchi, Scipio approved os his⁴ brother-in-law·s
having been put to death3 but still he was not, like many others,

Δ an obstinate advocate of the privileges of a class, for we find him

supporting the lex Carbia tabellaria against the aristocrats ( Cic„
Brut„ 25), whence he was considered by some as a man of the
people. (Oia, Aca, ii.,· 5.) Scipiowasopposedtoall violent meas·

certainly sincere and disinterested. But his opposition to the pop-
ular party deprived hini of a great part of the favor and influence
