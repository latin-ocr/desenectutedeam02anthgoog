counterbalanced by unremitting diligence on our part.” Lange and
others give compescenda, an inferior reading, though it has been sol·

Habenda ratio valemdinie. ‘⁴ Regard must be had by us to health,”
i. e., we must be regularly attentive to the article of health. Cato
here proceeds to lay down certain dietetic mles for the preservaf
tion os health amid advancing years—Tantum. ⁴⁴ Only so much.”—
Reficiantur. ‘⁴ May be reinvigorated.”—Hoee. Referring to mene
and animus. Observe here the employment of the demonstrative
in the neuter, as indicating things of different genders, and which
convey not a personal, but an ab'stract idea—Nisi tanquam lunzini,
dic. “ Unless you, as it were, pour oil gently into the lamp.” Lit-
mally, ‘⁸ pour oil gently in for the light,” i. e., to keep the light alive.
—Exercitatione ingravescunt. ‘⁴ Grow weary through exercise.'’
The old reading is defatigatione et exercitatione ingravescunt, the most
recent one (that os Klotz, Madvig, and others) exercitationum defati-
gatiam. Both, however, appear inferior to the one which we have
given.—-Levamur. ⁴⁶ Are refreshed.‘’ Equivalent to leviores et agi-
liores fiunt.

Num quoe ait Goeeilim, dec. ‘⁴ For as to those who, Caecilius says,
are the dotards represented in comedieS.” With senes supply esse.
The words comicos stultos senes are here quoted, with a change of
construction, from the passage of Caecilius Statius that occurs in
the De Amicitia, c. 26. The reference is to weak old men, repre-
sented on the stage to excite the laughter os the audience. The
humor of the ancient comedy frequently turned upon some old man,
who was exhibited throughout the piece as continually imposed upon
by the cunning os an artful slave and intriguing courtesan—Hos
significat. ⁴⁶ By these he means.” Literally, ‘⁸ he indicates these as
being,”—Dissolutoe. ‘⁴ Oareless.’' (consult Schiitz, Lex. ciceron„
s. v.)-—Libido. ‘⁴ The linense of the passions.''—Ista senilis stultitia. “
As described by Caecilius. Observe that ista here denotes contempt.
(Zumpt, 9 701.)—Deliratio. ⁶‘ Dotage.” The derivatiou‘ os this
word is as follows: lirare is‘ ‘⁴ to sow seed ju a surrow'’·(lira), and, os
course, in a straight line: a deviation from this was called deliratio,
and thence the metaphorica} usage os the word. In fact, this single
word expresses the whole of the stoie dogma, that the road to virtue
is a straight line, and every deviation from it equally criminal.
