ιουῐοοε in themselves‚” doc.x Observe that nihil opis ie here the
nme aa nihil virentis ae sapientia, end that the allusion is to the
well-known Stoic maxim that the wise man contained within him-
self all the means and requisites sor a happy existence. (Ritter,
Aac. Phil„ iii„ p. 583.μοηηὺ ctas gravis est· “Every stage of
human life is burdensome,” i. e., becsuoe they depend entirely on ex-
ternal causes, which ere wholly subject to the caprice of fortune.—
φησὶ nature necessitas afferat. This is in accordance with the Stoic
doctrine “ vivere convenienter nawroe.‘’ Compare Seneca, Epist„ ⁷1,
ἦ 24, 25 : ⁸⁴ Sapiens em erectam cub quolibet ponder-e,- nulla illum res
minorem facin nihil illi emm, quc ferenda sunt, meylem. Nam
quidquid cdere in hominem potest, in ne cecidisse non queritur.”

Adeptam. ‘⁸ When attained ποθ’ Α better reading then adepti.
‘⁴ On having atteined to it‚” end given by GernhanL Orelli, dac.—
Obrepere aiunt eam, doc. The idea on which the image is based lies
in Pliny’e “feles obrepunt avibuffl (H. N„ x., 73). Compare AEechi·
nes Socratic. (Axion-h„ c. 9), λαθὸν ὕπειςῆλθε τὸ γῆρας, and Juvenal
(im, 12⁹), ‘⁶ obrepit non intellecta emp-Falsum putare. “To

Adolescentia emme, duc. Thoee between the ages of seventeen
end forty-six were commonly called juniores, juvenes, or adolescen-
ειες thoee between forty-six and¹ sixty‚ seniores ,- and those above
sixty, senes. Hence we see that adducentis and senectus border on
each omen—Quam octogesimum. Observe that quam ie here for
potius quam--Nulla consolatione permulcere posset, dte. ‘⁴ Could
soothe a fooiish old age by no consolation (in ite power to impar-t),”
ι’. e., could by no means in its power console a weak and frivolous
mind under the usual consequencee os a prolong'ed existence.

Si soletis« ‘⁴ Since you are accustomed.” Observe that ει· with
the indicative has here the force of qnoniam, as denoting something
certain. Hed any doubt been imthed, the subjunctive would have
been used—Quo nunant digna esset. “And would that it were
worthy.” Observe‚ again, the employment of the relative to express
tho demonstrative with a conjunctioni. (Zumpt, §803.)—Noetroqu
cognomine. “And of the eui-name that has been bestowed upon me.”
The pronoun has here an objective force. The sni-name referred
tois that of Sapiens. His anceetore sor three generatione had been
named Μ. Porcius, and it is said ΡΞ Plutarch-(Vde. Cat. Μή, i.)
