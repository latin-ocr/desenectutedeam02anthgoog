ns some maintain, nor to n “asemon'’ as Gernhnrd tems it. We
have not hesitated, therefore, to adopt elegam, the reading of Bil-
lerbeck. (Compare Becker, obs. δαὶ, p. 493 Jen. Βίωνι, 1820, p.

151 ; Heidetb. Jahrb„ 1826, p. 9, 88.) The lines of Solon, to which
Cicero allodes, are as follows:

uno· ἐμοὶ darum-roc θάνατος μόλοι, ἀλλὰ φίλοισι
tollamque θονὸν ἄλγεα καὶ στοναχάς.

Cicero gives us the following translation of them in his Tusculan
Disputations (i., 49):

⁸⁴ Mon mea πε cerm lacrymis .- Βηρυτιων anticio
Maeror-ent, nt celebrent funera eum gemitu?

Sed haud scio, an, dcc. ‘⁶ Ennius perhaps, however, (has express·-
ed himself) δείξαθ’ As regards the form of expression haud ecio
an, which is intended to denote uncertainty, but with an inclination
in favor os the affirmative, consult, as before, Zumpt. 0 354, 721,
and with melius supply dixerit, or cecina-it. The more literal trans·
lation will require, in our idioni, the negative to be supplied with an,
‘⁶ 1 do not knoW, however, whether Ennius may not have expressed
himself better.'’—Neque funera fletu faxit. ‘⁶ Nor celebrate my fu-
nera1obsequies with weeping.” observo that faxit is the oid sorm'
sorsecerit. (Zumpt, ᾲ 161, noto.) This same quotation is given in a
fuller form in Tusa. Disp„ i., 15.

Sensus moriendi. ‘⁴ Perception of dying.” The idea intended to
be conveyed by the whole clause is as follows: the act of dying
may, indeed, be attended with a sense of pain, but it is a pain, how-
ever, which can not be os long continuance, dcc. The true reading
here is mandi, not morienti, as Ernesti and Wetzel maintain—Aut
optandus. “Is either· desirable‚'' i. e„ is either something that a
good and picus men ought to wish fon—Sine qua meditatione. Com·
pare Tute. Disp„ i., 30, extm- iii.. 16; Sem„ de Vit. Brev„ c. 7.—
Et ia incertum, an, dcc. “ And, perhaps, this very day.” Literally,
“and this is uncertain, whether (we are· not to die) on this very
dsy.” The expression interm m an fslls under the same rule as
haud noio σοι. (Consult remarks on haud scio on in 9 73, and Zumpt,

9 ³⁵4.)—-Anim consistere. ‘⁴ Be of firm mind.” ’

Non L. Brutum. “That not Lucius Brutus alone.’' Observe
that m here, and also in the clauses that follow, is equivalent to
non modo. The allusion is to L. Junius Brutus, the celebrated op-
