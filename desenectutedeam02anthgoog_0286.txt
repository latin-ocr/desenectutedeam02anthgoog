ture of the action, that makes this. distinction,” ι’. e, the distinc'tion

lies in the motive, notin the nature of the action-Qua quando utro-
accessit, dte. ‘⁸ And when the former is added to either side, that
side becomes the weightier of the two.” A metaphor taken from
the operation of weighing, the leading idea in propensus being that
of hanging, bending or inelining forward, hanging down, dcc. The
idea, therefore, is this, that it is the motivo which causes the bal-
ance to incline in this direction or in that.

Multa peccantur. ‘⁴ Many crimes are committed.” Cicero here
deviates from the principle laid down by him, and is obliged to re-
turn to what he calls popular opinion. The= murder of a slave, and
an act of parricide, both proceed equally from a single impulse of
the wilh and yet one of these actions is more criminal than th'e
other, because there are more rights and duties violated by it. The
atrocity of the crime, therefore, depends on the case itself, and not
on the moure—Qui insede ae domo, διο. The idea is, who.has
given him a habitation, a home, and a country—Multitudine pecca·
torum. ‘⁶ In the multitude of crimes that, are involved in it.”-
Fingere. “ Imagine.” Some read figere, and compare Horat„ Od.,
iii„ 15, 2.—Modum tenere. · ,“ Exercise a control.”

Extra numerum. ‘⁴ Out of the proper measure.” Compare the
explanation of Wetzel: ‘⁸ Si in saltando peccavit contra leges salta-
tionis.” The reference in numerus is not merely to the music, but
also to the movements of the dance as consequent thereon.—Si
versus pronuntiatus est, διο. The actoris not hissed for any negli-
gent pronunciation of the line, but the line itself is hissed, and the
actor as the representative of the poet. Hence we have the nom·-
inative with the passive verb, ,not ei versum pronuntiavit—Omni
gestu moderatior. ‘⁶ More carefully regulated than any theatrical
'gesture.'’-—-Aptior. “ More exact.’''—- Tu. ut in syllaba te peccasse di·
ces? “ Win you say that you have erred as in the case of a sylla-
ble merely 'l'' i. e., will you say that a fault committed in life is no
greater than that in the case of a syllable which mars the measure
of a verse Z—Poetam non audio in nugis. ‘⁶ I take no excuse from a
poet in matters of a trifling nature‚” i. e., where mere empty fictions
,are concerned. Observe that non audio is here equivalent in effect
to non accipio excusationenw-Digitis peccata dimetientem sua. A met-
. apher horrowed from the custom, on the part of poets, of measuring
offtheir verses by the aid of their fingeres-Quen ei visa eunt brevi·
