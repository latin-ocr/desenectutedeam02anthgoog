bodily strength‘ and activity to the laat3 so that in the war against
Hasdrubal, only two years before his death, he not only commanded
his army in person, but was able to go through all his military ex·

CHAPTER XI.

Non suntin ammte vires. A new objection, which Cato himself
brings sorward. Compare chapter vii„ at the commencemeat, and
chapter ix., ὑ 27.-Εε legibus et institutio. “By both the laws and
institutione of our country.”--Muneribuae. Military and senatorian
employments are here meant. By the Roman law, no one could be
compelled to engage in military service aster fisty, nor any senator
summoned to attend in the senate-house aster sixty years of age.—
Non modo. For non modo non. (Zumpt, § ⁷24, ὀ.)

Ae ita medii, dte. “ But there are many old men so utterly en·
feebled,” &c. Another objection is here advanced, aa before, by
Cato himself, and then answered also by him-Nem proprium se-
mancis, ὄιο. “ Is not a defect peculiar to age, but one common to
health in general,” i. e., but the ordinary effect of ill health at any
period of life.- Quam fait imbecillus, dcc. This clause is incorrectly
punctuated in almost all the editions, not even excepting those of
Orelli and Madvig. There should be no comma aster ἑο, but one
before it. The form is qui, without any intervening comma, refers
to an individual as already well known ; whereas filine is‘, qui carries
with .it an unseasonable and altogether unnecessary opposition to
the other son of Africanae, who was so contemptible a character.
The son os Africanus mentioned in the text was P. Cornelius Scipio,
who was augur in Bc. 180. Cicero speaks os him here as a man
os more extensive acquirements than his father, and describes him
elsewhere (Brut, 1⁹3 De Off„ i., 33) as a person of great mental
powers. His feeble constitution, however, prevented him from be·
coming at all eminent either in civil or military lise. (Compare
Nauck, Neue Jahrb„ 12 supp. vol„ p. 564.)

Alterum illud exstitisset, dte. We have given illud with Orelli
and Madvig, instead of ille, the common reading.—Lumen civitatis.
Cato means that the son of Africanus would otherwise have been a ι
source of as much glory to the state as his father had been-Doc-
trina uberior. ‘⁶ A richer store of general knowledge.”—Ejusque
vitia diligentia compensanda eunt. ⁴⁴ And its infirmities are to bc
