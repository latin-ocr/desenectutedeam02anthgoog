torches, and also simply-'the torch itselt? It has the 'latter meaning
in the present instance, as Gesner correctly remarks (Lat. Theseum,
s. a), not the former, as Gronovius maintains (Oba, iii„ 6). Lipsius
(Mi-scell„ iv.) thinks that we ought to read cerco sor crebro, and he
has been followed by some editore, but the MSS. are against him.
—Quoe eibi nulli exemplo, dcc. The language here employed can
only mean that Duilius had assumed these marks of distinction

himsels; whereas Livy (Elpia, xvii.) states expressly that they were
conferred upon him by the people.

Sed quid ego alios? ‘Supply nomina-Soada. ‘⁴ My table-breth-
ren.” The term sodalis, as here employed, means a member of a
confraternity or brotherhood, established in honor of some particu-
lar divinity‚ sor the purpose of celebrating an annual festival. While
the festivales the divinity lasted, the sodales lived at a common table.
-Sodalitataes. ‘⁶ Confraternities‚'’ i. 6., associations of sodales.—
Me questore emtitutoe eunt, 610. ‘⁴ Were instituted during my
quaestorship, when the Idaean rites of the Great Mother w‘ere received

age os Cybele, the Great Mother of the gods, was conveyed‚ in ac-
cordance with an oracle, from Pessinos in Phrygia to the city of
Rome. (Lim, xxix„ 14. Compare, however, xxxvi„ 36, where
this is made to have occurred one year previous.)—Idaei³'. Cybele
was called the Idaean goddess, and her rites the Idaean- rites, from
Mount Ida in Phrygia, and also from its namesake in Crete—Sed
erat quidam servor atatis. ‘⁸ Although there was, at the same time,
(it must be confessed), acertain gayety os spirits natural to our age,”
i. e„ to our then earlier years—Maiora. “More sostened down.”

Coetu et sermonibus. ‘⁴ By the society and converse.''—Accubiti0·
nem epularem amicorum. ‘⁴ A collection of friends at a feast.’' More
literally‚ ‘⁶ a reclining of friends at a feast.’' The Romans, as is
well known, reclined on couches at their meals.—Ganvivium. ‘⁴ A
convivium, or living together.” From con and viva—Qui Ιιοε idem
tum compotationem, duc. ‘⁸ Who call this same thing at⁴ ene time s
comparativa, at another a concoenation.” The term compotatio is
meant to cor-respond to the Greek συμπόσιον, and comitatio to σύν-
demon, the former of which means a drinking party, and the latter
a supping or eating together; while both terms seem to suppose
that, according to the Greek way os thinking, the primary advant-
ages os a feast consisted in the gratification of the appetite?
