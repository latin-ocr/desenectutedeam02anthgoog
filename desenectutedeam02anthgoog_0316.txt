was not the slightest pretext sor hostilities; and nothing could be
’ more fiagrantly unjust than the determination of Crassus. It was
in 'express violation of treaties; for in the year B.c. 92, Sulla had
concluded a treaty os peace with the Parthians, and the treaty had
been renewed by Pompey with their king, Phraates. The Romans
were not very scrupulous in their career of conquest, and they osten
‘fought from motives os gain or ambition; but their ostensible rea-
sons generally bore some show of plausibility, and a total disregard
os form was offensive to a people who were accustomed, in their
intemational dealings, ιο observe certain legal and religione tech-
nicalities. It was not surprising,¹ therefore, that, apart from polit-
ical consideratione, the feelings os common justice should excite a
strong repugnance ιο the plane of Crassus< who, having gained his
i‘mmediate object in obtaining Syria as his province, breke out into
a display of childish vanity and boastfulness, which were alien from
his usual demeanor. O. Ateius Capito, the tribune, ordered his
officer ιο arrest Crassus, but was obliged to release him by the in·
tercession of his colleagues. However, he ran on ιο the gate of
the city to intercept the consul, who was anxious without delay ιο
proceed ιο his destination, and resolved- ιο set out at once,-without
waiting for the termination of his year of office. Posted at the gate,
Ateius kindled a fire, and with certain fumigations, and libations,
and invocatione os strange aad terrible deities, mingled the most
awsul curses and imprecatious against Crassus. This was done in

‘ pursuance σι’ an ancient Roman rite, which was never solemnized

on light grounds; sor, while it was believed to be fatal to the per·
son devoted, it was also thought ιο bring calamity upon the person
who devoted another. But Crassus was not deteri-ed. He pro·
cecded on his'way ιο Brundisium. The evil omen daunted tho
army, and seems to have occasioned an unusual attention to disas-
trous augur-ies and forebodings ; for Plutarch is copious in his ac-
count οι· tokens of* missortune in almost every stage of the expe—
dition. ·

The route of Crassus lay through Macedonia, Thrace, the Hel-
lespont, Galatia, and the northern part of Syria to Mesopotamia.
Throughout the whole campaign he' exhibited so much imprudence,
and such a complete neglect of the first principles os the military
art, that premature age may be thought to have impaired his facul-
ties, though he was now but little more than sixty years old. He
was deas, and looked older than he really was. The aged Deiota*
rus, whom he met in Galatia, rallied him on his coming late into·
the field. He was accompanied by some able men, especially the
