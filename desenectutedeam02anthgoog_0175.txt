ply videa—Adolescentia. “Youth,'’ i. e., the young man. The ab·
straet for the concrete. ‘ .
Vitio-vius. “With worse taste.’‘— Tum equidem, dcc. These two

lines are iambic trimeters‚ like those that precede. In the ‘second
line, the long a in ea loses one os its component short vowels by
elision, but the remaining short one is lengthened by the arsis.

Jucundum potius, duc. “ N ay, pleasing rather than odious !” The

Equivalent to tolerabilior. A sar· better reading than leniat—Qui a

‘⁶ You see, then, how that old age is not merely languid and inact-
ive.” The term iners here refers to an aversion sor active labor.

of knowledge in old agc.-—Versibus. The verse here referred to is
γηράσκω δ’ αἰεὶ πολλὰ διδασκόμενος.· lt is cited by Plato, in his Ti-
moeus; by Plutarch, in the Life os Solon ; and by the scholiast on
the Antigone of Sophocles, v. ’HL—Senem fieri. According to Di-
ogenes Laertius (i., 62), Solon reached the age os eighty years.
Lucian, however (Marah, 18), makes him to have lived one hund-
red—Qui (ἔπειτα literas, dvc. ‘⁸ Who have made myseli' acquaint-
ed with Grecian literature when advanced in years.” Cato, as we
have before remarked, was acquainted in early lise with the lan-
guage, but not with the literature, of Greece. He was averse to
the latter from the influence of a strong national prejudice‚ which
diminished, however, in force as he grew older and wiser.— Ut ea
ipsa milui nota essent, dcc. This is thrown in by Cicero, in order to
account for the Greek erudition possessed hy one who had been,· in
his younger days, so averse to its acquirement. (Compare chap. i.,
ς 3; “ Qui si eruditius videbitur disputare,” &c.)-Eaeemplis. “As
illustratione (of what Ι say).”—Quod cum fecisse Socratem, &c.
