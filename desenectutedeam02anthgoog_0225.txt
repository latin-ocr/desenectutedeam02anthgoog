Μ. Τ. CICERONIS LAELIUS, dvc. “Marcus Tullius Cicero’s
Laelius, or conceruing Friendship.” This work was written aster
*the preceding, to which it may be regarded as forming a companion.
Just as the dissertation upon Old Age was placed in the mouth of
Cato,'because he had been distinguished sor energy of mind and
body, preserved entire to the very end of a long nib, so the steadsast

attachment which existed between Scipio Africanus the Younger ⁶

and Laelius pointed out the latter as a person peculiarly fitted to
enlarge upon the advantages of friendship, and the mode in which
it might best be cultivated. To no one could Cicero dedicate such
a treatise with more propriety than to Atticus, the only individual
among his contemporaries to whom he gave his whole heart.

The imaginary conversation is supposed to have takeu‘place be·
tween Loelius and his two sons-in-law, C. Fannius-and Q. Mucius
Scaevola, ‘a few days aster the death pf Africanus the Younger (Bc,
129); and to have been repeated in aster times by Scoevola to
Cicero. Loelius begins by a panegyric ou his friend. Theu, at the
request of the young men, he explains his own sentimenta with re·
gard to the origin, nature, limits‚ aud value of ffiendship; traces its
connection with ‘the higher moral virtues, and lays down the rules
which ought to be obser-ved in order to render it permanent and
mutually advantageous. The most pleasing feature in this essayn is
the simple sincerity with which it is impressed. The author casts
aside the affectation of learning, and ‚the reader feels convinced
throughout that he is speaking from his heart. In giving full ex-
pression to the most amiable feelings, his experience, knowledge of
human nature, 'and sound sense, enabled him to avoid all fantastic
exaggeration3 and, without sacrificing his dignified tone, or pitching
his standard too loW, he brings down the subject to the level of or-
dinary comprehension, and sets before us a model which all may

imitate.
