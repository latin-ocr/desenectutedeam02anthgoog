—Aa voluptatem ecee reserenda. ‘⁸ Should be referred to pleasure,’'
i. 0., should originate in pleasure as their leading motive and aim.
There is no philosopher in antiquity who has been so violently at-
tacked‚ and whose ethical doctrines have bee'n so much mistaken
and misunderstood, as Epicurus. The cause 01· this singular phie-
nomenon was partly a super-licini knowledge 01· his philosophy, os
which Cicero, sor example, is guilty to a very great extent, and part-
ly, also, the conduct of men who called themselves Epicuream, and
who, taking advantage of the sacility with which his ethical theory
was made the haudmaid 01· a sensual and debauched life, gave them·
solves up to the enjoyment os sensual pleasures. At Rome, and du-
ring the time 01· Mman ascendency in the ancient world, the phi-
losophy os Epicurus never took any firm root, and it is then and
there that, owing to the paramount influence of 'the Stoic philosophy,
’ we meet with the bitterest antagonists os Epicurus. Cato here en-
tirely mistakes the meaning of the term pleasure in its Epicurean
sense. Pleasure, with Epicurus, was not a mere momentary and
transitory sensation, but he conceived it as something lasting and
im'perishable, consisting in pure and noble mental enjoyments, that
is, in ἀταραξία and ἀπονία, οι· the freedom from pain and from all
influeuces which disturb the peace of our mind, and thereby our hap-
piness, which is the result 01· it. The summum bonum, according to
him, consisted in this peace of mind; and the great problem os his
ethics, therefore, was to show how it was to be attained. This,
then, was the meaning 01· Epicurus when he maintained that all our
actions ought to have pleasure (peace os mind) as their leading mo-
tive and aim. (Smilla, Dict. Biogr„ ii„ p. 34.)
