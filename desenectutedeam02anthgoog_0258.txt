Q 67.

Subdifficilis. ⁴⁶ Somewhat difficult‚” i. ae., when sought to be βτα-

thio would be at variance with what follows. (Compare Seyffert, ad ‘
loc.)—Quando. “At any time.'' For aliquanda—Vetewima quaque,
ut ea vina, ἁο. Compare the language of scripture : “ Forsake not
an old friend; sor the new ienot comparable to him ; a new friend

(Ea-les„ ix„ 10.)—Quoe vetustatem serunt. “ That bear agam-Mut-
ιω modios salis, ὰο. “ That many peok's of salt are to be eaten with
a man, in order that the duty of friendship may be thoroughly ful·
fflled‚” ἰ. e„ ‘that we must make use osa friend for a long time, be-
fore we can be able to determine whether he be truiy a friend or
not. Compare Aristode, Eth. ad·Nicmn.‚ viii„ 3, ᾧ 6: κατὰ τὴν

evoment. ⁴

timacy.’' Observa the hendiadys.—Ipso equo. “ In the case of the
horse himself-”-In Ῑιοε, quod est animal. ‘⁸ In the case of this,
which is an animal.”—Superiorcm parem esse inferiori. “ That the

age in point of rank or talenta ,should never appear sensible of his
superiority.—In nostro, ut ita dicam, grege. ‘⁶ In our little group, if
1 may so express myself,” i. e., in our little circle of friends.—
Philo. Compare chap. iv„ ἡ 14.—Rupilio. Compare chap. xi„ o
:sm—Mummio. Spurius Mummius, brother of L. Mummius Achai-
cus. In politica he was opposed to ‘his brother,x and was a high
aristocrat, which will account sor his intimacy with the younger
Africanus. - Q. Maximum, fratrem. Scipio’s elder brother was
adopted by Q. Fabius Maximus, and became Q. Fabius Maximus
AEmilianus.—Per se esse ampliores. ‘⁶ To become of more conse·
