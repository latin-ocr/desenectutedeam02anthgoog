Auxit hoc officium, &c ‘⁴ He added to this obligiug conduct by

another act of liberality also.”—Seoe modii tritici. The modius was '

the principal dr} measure os the Romans, and contained one gallon,
⁷·8576 pints· English. The common text has septem, which can not
be correct, and must have arisen from au error os the copyists (VII.
for VI.). It is well ascertained that the Attio medimnus was equal
to ’δίκαιοι seven) Roman modii. (Consnlt Wurm, de pond.„num.,
mens„ &c., rationibus, 1>-x 131 ς and ΒόεΙεΙι, Δίεινοὶτ Πηεετειιεή., p. 204.)
—M edimnue. In Greek, μέδιμνος, or μέδιμνος campos. This was the
principal dry measure of the Greeks, and used especially for meas·
uring corn. It was equal, as J'ust stated, to six Roman modii, or
eleven gallons, 7·1456 pinta English.

CHAPTER. III.

Communis infimis, dcc. ‘⁴ Affable ιο the lowest, equal to the high-
est‚” i. a, equal, in point of merit and public esteem, to the first
men of the state. As regards the force of communie here, com-
. pare the explanation of Tzschucke: ‘⁶ Qui se non superbe supra
alios extollit, inferiores maxime, sed se ad eos demittit, communis voca·
tur.” -- civemque facere studerent. This was regarded as a high
honor, and was only 'conseri-ed upon those who had deserved well
os the state. (Compare Meursius, Fortun. Ate„ c. 5.)—Quo beneficio
ille uti noluit. Cicero, however, calls him a citizen os Attica (Ep.
all Ata.. i., 163 xi„ 1); but. this refers, as would appear, merely to
his cognomen, not to any actual citizenship—Amic& civitatem Ro·
mamm, dcc. “ That Roman citizenship was lost in case any other

was assumed,” i. e., acquir-ed. This was in strict accordance with
the Roman law. Under the emperors, however, a milder rule pre-

vailed, and a Roman citizen was allowed ιο acquire the rights of
citizenship in another state. (consult Salmas„ Obsern. ad Jus Ate. ’
et Rom„ c. 26.)

Ipsi et Phidia. The Phidias here meant must not, of course, be
confounded with the celebrated sculptor and statuary, who flourished
long before„ The reference is ιο *some individual of the same name,
whose faithful public services procured for him the bonor mentioned
in the text; but of whom no account is given by any ,other writer.
Some editors, therefore, regarding this Phidias as a personage al·-
together unknown, read Pilia sor Phidiae, and make Nepos refer to
Pilia, the wife os Atticus, whom Cicero often names in his letters
