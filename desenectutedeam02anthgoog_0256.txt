privileges of friendship, in certain circumstances, superior to moral
obligations of a much higher and more sacred nature. If we com.

pare, however, with the present passage the language os the treat· ·

ise De Officiis, a work subsequently published. we will find therein an
idea of what Cicero means by summa turpitudo, which may tend to
remove the difficulty alluded to. Thus we have in chap. x., book iii„
of the latter work, the following limits established: “ Neque contra
rempublicam, neque contra jusjurandum ac fidem, amici causa, vir bonus
saciet.”—Est enim quatenus. ‘⁸ For there is a limit up to which.”
-Nec vero . . . . nec. ⁴⁴ Neither on the one hand, indeed ..... nor
on the other.”—Telum. In the sense os instrumentum—Quam col-

Quod omnibu-5 in rebus, doc. Thiswhole passage, down to judica-
rent, is drawn from* Xenophon's Memorabilia, ii., 4. 2, seqq.-Nec
habere quasi signa quadam, dac. Some of these “ sigm,” however,
are given by Isocrates (ad Damon„ p. 11, ed. Wolf.): Μηδένα φίλον
ποιοῦ, πρὶν ἂν Effer-riom· πῶς κέχρηται τοῖς προτέροις φίλοις, ιε. τ. λ.-
Et judicare difficile est, διο. “And it is difficult, indeed, to judge of
one unless previously tried.'’--·Ita proeourrit amicicia judicium, dcc.
“In this way friendship is wont to outstrip judgment, and to take
away the means of making-a trial.'’

Sustinere. “To restrain.”--Impetum benevolentia. He means
the impulse of rushing into the arms of a new friend, before we have,
in some degree at least, put his moral qualifications to the test.—
Quo utamur, doc. Observe that quo is here the conjunction; not
the relative pronoun, as Klotz makes it.—-In parva pecunia. i. In
the case of a small sum of money.”—Perspiciuntur quam sint leves,
An imitation of the Greek construction for perspicitur quam leves
sint quidam.-C'ognoscuntur. ‘⁶ Are found out.”—Imporia. ‘⁶ Com-
mands of armie8.’'-—Potestates. ‘⁶ Civil authority.'’—-Opes. ‘⁴ Po-
litical influence.”—Propocita eine. ‘⁸ Are placed before the view.”
—Obscuratum iri. ‘⁴ That this circumstance will bo thrown into the
shade‚” i. e., that the world will be too much dazzled by the splen-

dor of the objects to take notice of the ἱ unworthy sacrifice they
make to obtain them.
