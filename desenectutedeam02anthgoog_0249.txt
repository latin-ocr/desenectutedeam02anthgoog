words magna aliqua re, which precede the proposition in the ordinary.
text, appear to be a mere gloss—Impietatis. ‘⁴ of impiety (toward
their country.)”-Ingratae patria injuriam, dcc. ‘⁶ Did not patiently
-endure the wrong inflicted by his ungratesul country, which he
-ought to have so endured.” Ernesti regards the words quam serre
debuit as an interpolation3 but they appear necessary to the sen-
tence, since otherwise it might be inferred from the expression in-
grata patrioe that Loelius approved of his conduct. (Seyffert, ad loc.)
Scheller's suggestion, that quam be taken as a particle, equivalent
to ut, or quemad-modum, ‘⁴ as,'' is unfortunate, since Themistocles
did not endure the injury at all. (Senem, Oba, p. aereo—Mortem
sihi uterque conscivit. The suicide os Themistocles is extremely
doubtful. Thucydides evidently did not believe that he put an end
to his own life by poison ; and, indeed, as Thirlwall remarks, it is
hardly credible that sear of disappoiuting the Persian king should
have urged him to such an act. (Thirlwall, Hist. Gr„ vol. ii., p.
431, Svo cd.) so, also, various accounts were given of the death
of Coriolanus. (Compare Liv.. ii.,40; Cic„ Brut.,10; Waclismutla,
Gesclt. des Ram. Staates, p. 313.)

ters have of late begun to ge, this same thing, perhaps, may at some
future time actually take place.'’ Quod refers to what immediately

appears, from several oblique insinuations scattered throughout this
performanee, that although Cicero's principal design, in drawing it
up, was to settle the true measure and offices of a ver'y important

moral connection, yet he had an indirect view, likewise, to the par· ·

ticular principles os the times, and the circumstances in which pub-
lic affairs stood when he composed the work. The present passage
evidently glauces at the partisans of Julius Caesar. · (Melmoth, ad
