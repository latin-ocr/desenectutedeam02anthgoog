¹'run sommum SCIPIONIS.

M. TULLII CICERONIS SOMNIUM SCIPIONIS. “M.'Tullius
Cicero’s Dream of Scipio.” The account of this dream, or vision,⁸
is put into the mouth of the younger Scipio Africanus„who relates'
that, in early youth, ‘when he first served in Africa, he visited the
court of Masinissa, the steady friend of the Romans, and particu-
larly of the cornelian family. During the feasts and entertainments
of the day, the conversation turned on the'words and actions of the
first great Scipio. His adopted grandson having retired to rest, the '
Shade of the departed hero appeared to him in sleep, darkly fore·

2 . told the future events'of his life, and encouraged him to tread in‘

the pathe os patriotism and true glory, by announcing the reward·
prepared in a future state for those who have served their country -
faithfuuy in this life. The circumstances of time and place selected

for this dream, as well as the characters introduced, have been

most felicitonsly chosen; and Cicero has nowhere more happily
united a high reach of thought to brilliant imagination.

Macrobius, to whom we are indebted sor the preservation of the
Somnium Scipionis, has given a curione astronomical, or, rather, aa·
trological commentary on the influence of numbers in forming the .
crisis os Scipio’s life. His tract was greatly admired and exten-
sively studied during the Middle Ages, and contains a succession
of discourses on the physical constitution os the universe, according

'to the views of the New Platonists, together with notices of some
of their peculiar tenete on mind as well as matter.

The Somnium Scipionis originally formed part of Cicero' s work
De Republica, being contained in the sixth book. It has been pub-'
lished by Mai in his edition os the recovered De Republica, and also
in the edition of Creuzer and Moser, Frankfi, 1826, Svo. The au-
thenticity of the piece has been attacked by Kunhardt, in Seobode’s
Kritiscloe Bibliothek fiir das Schul- und Unterrichtswcsen, 1820 (p.
4⁷4-4823 558-565; 649-653·‚ low-100⁷), and ably defended by,
Moser.
