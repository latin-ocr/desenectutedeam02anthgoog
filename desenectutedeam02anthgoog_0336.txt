those under the same meridian, hut opposite parallels3 and by ἀντ-ἱ-
ποὸες, those who were in opposite parassels eqd meridiane, i. e.‚
diametrieally opposite-Quasi quibusdam, duc. The term quasi is
again employed ιο excuse the use of terms not usual with Cicero,
namely‚ redimitam and cingulis. The reference is to the moed—-

were regarded by the ancients as uninhabitable. (Compare Horae„
i.‚ 22, 17, and Vir-g„ Georg„ i.‚ 283.)—Diversos. The adjective di·
versuo is osten used by Cicero, as here, in the sense of oppositus or
contrarius. Compare Or. de ng. Agr„ ii„ 32, 87: “ Corinthus . ἶ .
duo maria, maxime navigationi diversa, . . . conjungebat.” So, also,

to be also uninhabitable.—Adversa vobio urgent vestigia. “ Plane
footsteps directly opposite to you,’' i. 8., are your antipodes.

Propter eluviones, dte. This is in accordance with the Stoic doc-
trine, that the world is liable ιο destruction from the prevalence of
moisture, or os dryness3 the former producing a universal inunda-
