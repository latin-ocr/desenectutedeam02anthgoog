aliud quoddam filum, dec. “ But the style and spirit os your own dis-
course is a different thing of its kind,” i. e., your mode of handling
the subject is a very different thing from theirs. supply eet with
filum. Gernhard reads quoddam eet filum at once. Other editors,
as, sor example, Ernesti and Schutz, have quoddam expetimus filum,
and others, again, expectamus. Our reading is that of Orelli and
Madvig—In hortis Scipionis, dcc. Compare chap. iv„ ᾴ 14. —- Qua-
lis tum patronus justit-ite, dte. The third book of the De Republica,
as we glean from Lactantius and St. Augustino, contained a pro·
tracted discussion on the famous paradox of Carneades, that justice
was a visionary delusion. L. Furius Philus advocated on that oc-
casion the doctrine of Carneades, and Loelius opposed it.—Contra
accuratam orationem Phili. ‘⁸ Against the elaborate discourse of
Philus.'’ The epithet accuratus, in accordance with its etymology,
is properly applied to things on which great care and labor have

Vim hoc quidem est afferre! “ This, indeed, is offering positive
violence !” i. e., this is pressing me beyond all power of resist-
ance. -- Studiis generorum. ⁴⁸ The eager wishes os my sons-in·
laW,” i. e.‚ of two such esteetned relatives as you are—Propter
imbecillitatem, &c. ‘⁸ On account of the weakness and wants of
man.'’ This is the Epicurean view os the subject, namely, that
friendships are to be formed with reference to the utility to be de-
rived from them. Such, als0, in later days, was the opinion of
Rochel'oucault: “ C'e que les hommes ont nomme' amiciti„ n’est qu'une
societe, qu’un menagement reciproque d'interet, et qu'un e‘ehange de
bons office35 ce n'eet enfin qu’un commerce, ou l'amour propre se pro-
pose toujours quelque chose ὰ gagner.”-Meritie. “Kindnesses.”—-
Hoc quidem. ‘ Referring to the bestowing and receiving of kindness-
ee, as just mentioned. -Sed antiquior, et pulchrior, dcc. ‘⁴ But,
(whether there might not be, at the same time‚) a more deeply-
seated‚ and a nobler, and a different motive originating in our very
