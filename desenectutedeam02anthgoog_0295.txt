P. Cornelius Cethegus, the friend of Marius, and a man of notori-
ously bad lise. He retained, however, great power and influence
, aster Sulln’s death, whose party he had espoused in Re. ·83, after
abandoning that of Marius ; and Lucullus did not disdain to entreat
his concubine to use her interest in his favor when he was secking ‘
to obtain the command of the war against Mithradates, (Plan,-
=Lucull., v., ὃς compare Cic.,'pro cluent„ 31.)-—.Amplissimi. “Men
of the 'highest standing.”—E:rceesit. “Has departed,” i. ‘e., has
ceased.—Adoleecentibus paullo loquacioribus, dcc. ‘⁴ One must, then,
be a slave to young men a little more talkative than ordinary.” The
allusion is to young men who fancy themselves eloquent, but who
are, in reality, talkative rather than eloquent, and who seek some
opportunity of making their imagined powers of oratory known by
accusing some great criminal. Α Unto these the individual referred
t0.in the text must bend the knee in abject submission, and strive
to propitiate their favor.—Qui aliquid scire videntur. *ἢ Who appear
⁶ to know any thing (respecting him)‚’' i. a, to be privy to any of his
malefacis-duda. Lambinus prefers Index. But compare De Lag„
i., 14, 41: “Nihil times nisi‘toetem ct judicem ‚·” and also Pau-aa„ u,

vilia (Bc. 106), by which it was proposed to restore to the equites
the privilege of furnishing judices for public trials, which was then
in the hands of the senatorian order. The speech of Crassus on
this occasion was one os remarkable power and eloquence, and ex-
pressed'the strength of his devotion to the aristocratic party; but
Cicero'finds fault with it, both here and elsewhere (De wat„ i., 52).
as having been couched in too fawning a tone towards the people,
and one calculated ιο lower the character ef the senatorial order
with the wise and the good—Eripite nos ea· servitute. The passage
is quoted more fully and consecutively in the De Orat„ i., 52. The
allusion in :mittite is to the various acts of injustice toward the sen·
atorian order of which the equestrian jndices had been guilty, and
which are compared to the yoke of a ‘regular servitude. —Omm‘e Ι
autimi debilitati, dte. “Any kind os apprehension on the part of a

—In libertatem vindicari. “To be set free (from any yoke).‘ ’—Nist
