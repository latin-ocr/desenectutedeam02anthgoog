figurative reference to the operations of the mind, it is employed
either alone, as in Tusa, i., 30, or with animo added. (Compare Orc
pro Deice„ 14, 4⁰.)—Quatuor reperio causas. consult Introductory
notes—Quod avocet. Observe in this clause, as well as in those
that immediately follow, the employment of the subjunctive to in-

emphatic one in the sentence, and as referring immediately to what
has gone before. Observa, moreover, that si takes here the indic-
ative, because the speaker has no⁴ doubt that what he is going to do
will prove acceptahle to his hearers—Quanta. ⁴⁸ How weighty.’‘

any others‘! or merely from those,” dec„ and to the latter clause
an affirmative answer is always expected. (consult Zumpt, ο 353,
and the remarks of Nauck, Neue Jahrb„ 12 supp. vol„ p. fiam—Ju-
