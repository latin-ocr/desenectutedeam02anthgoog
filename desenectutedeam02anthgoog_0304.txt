attack upon Cicero by proposing a law to the effect that whoever
had taken the life of a citizen uncondemned and without a trial,
should be interdicted from fire and water. . Cicero here committed
a fatal mistake. Instead of assuming the bold front of conscious in-
nocence, he at once took-guilt unto himself, and, without awaiting
the progress of events, changed his attire, and; assuming the garb
osone accused, went round the sorum soliciting the compassion of
all whom he met.

For a brief period public sympathy was awakened. A large num-
ber of the senate and the equites appeared also in mourning, and
the better portion of the citizens seemed resolved to espouse his
cause. But all demonstratione of such feeling were promptly· re-
pressed by the new consuls, Piso and Gabinius, who from the first·
displayed steady hostility, having been bought, as above stated, by
the promises of Clodius. The rabble were infuriated by the inces-
sant harangues of their tribune; nothing was to be hoped from
Crassus ς the good offices of Caesar had been already rejected; and
Pompey‚ the last and only saseguard, contrary to all expectatione,
and in violatiou of the most solemn engagements, kept aloof, and,
from real or pretended sear os some outbreak, refused to interpose.
Upon this, Cicer0, giving way to despair, resolved to yield to the

into exile.

On the same day on which Cicero lest the city Clodius procur-'ed
the enactment of two laws, one to interdict Cicero from fire and
water, because he had illegally put citizens to death and forged a
decree of the senate3 the other, forbidding any one, on pain of the
like penalty, to receive him. The interdict was, however, limited

to the distance of four hundred miles from Rome. Clodius added “

the clause, that no proposition should ever be made for reversing
the decree till those whom Cicero had put to death should come to
lise again. The law was confirmed iu the Comitia ΤΙ-ἰδυῖα, and en-
graven on brass. On the same day, the consuls Gabinius and Piso
had the provinces of Syria and Macedonia assigned to them, with
extraordinary powers. Clodius next rid himself of Μ. Cato, who,
by a decree passed on his motion, was sent with the powers of
praetor to take possession os the Island of Cyprus, with the treasure
of its king, Ptolemy, and to restore some Byzantius exiles. In the
so'rmer nefarious proceeding‚ Clodius seems to have taken as a pre-
text the will os Ptolemy Alexander 1.‚ the uncle of the cyprian king,
who, as the Romans pretended, had made over to them his kingdom.

Immediately after the banishment of Cicero, Clodius set tire to
