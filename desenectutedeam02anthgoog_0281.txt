Hujus orationis ac sententie. “ Of this mode of speaking, and of
the sentiments here advocated.”— Corinthiis operibus. “In articles
of Corinthian workmanship.” The reference is to statues, columns,
dre, but, more particularly, to vessels of Corinthian brass. (Com-

Voluptatem esse summum bonum. The doctrine of the Cyrenaio

school, so called from its founder, Aristippus, a native of Cyrene.
The Cyrenaic doctrine would appear to have arisen from a misap· ι
plication of the Socratic. Socrates considered happiness (i. e., the
enjoyment of a well-ordered mind) to be the aim of all men; and
Aristippus, taking up this position, pronounced pleasure the chief
good, and pain the chief evil; but he wished the mind to preserve
its authority in the midst of pleasure. (smith, Dict. Biogr„ s. v.)—
