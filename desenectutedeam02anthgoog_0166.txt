ron (ὀξῦμωρον). We have given the reading suggested by Lambi-
nus, which harmonines with the Greek version of Gaza. Gruter
and others read via, i. e., viae, in the ablativo. The common text
of the fragments of Ennius has dementi sese fleme ruina, which
Gruter very properly condemns. Some editors, and among them
Ernesti, give &mmet use flexere? omitting viai. Others, again, .
have &menta me flaura vieta, the conjecture of Scaliger, vieta
having the force of languida, or viribus privata—Vitii. Observa
the long penult, and consult Anthon’e Latin Proaeody, p. 19.

Ec tannen ipsine Appii, doc. ‘⁸ And yet the speech os Appius him·
sels is still extant,” i. a„ although the speech itself of Appius is still
extant. The meaning is this: Even‚ however, is yon were not ac-
quainted with the poem of Ennius, yet the extant speech- itself would
put you in full possession of all the circumstances of the case.
ι Plutarch (Vir. Pyrrh„ 19) gives ns the substance of this celebrated
oration—Ha illo egit. Not hano, as the common text has it, since
agere orationem, notwithstanding the defence of it made by Scheller,
is not good Latinity.—Septem et decem annis, dte. The time meant
is A.U.c. 474, Rc. 280, the second consulship of Appius having
been in A.U.C. 458, Rc. 296. The seventeen years are made up
by including in the computation, according, to the Roman custom,
both the years 280 and 296, or 4⁷4 and 458.--Intersuiseent. Better
*⁸ than inter-fluxissent, the reading of some editions, which is not Cice-
ronum—Ante superiorem comulatam. His first consulship is meant.
He was elected censor in Rc, 312, with C. Plautius, without hav-
. ⁸ing been consul previously, and he held the censorship until B.C.
307, when, after resigning this office, he was chosen consul sor· the

, first‘ time—Grandem. Supply atate, or annis. Supposing that he

>obtained the consulship at the legal age (43 years), he would be at '
the period referred to in the text nearly 70 years old.‘-Et tamen
sic a patribus accepimus. The idea intended to be conveyed by this
is well expressed by Otto: “ Et, quamquam plane grandis natu erat
Appius, tamen hoec eum hac aetate fecisse accepimus a patribus.”

Nihil igitur afferunt. ‘⁴ Those persons, therefore, bring sorward a

mere nullity.” Compare muorbach, ‘⁴ Diejenigen bringeri aleo so gut
wie Nichts vor.'’ A much inferior reading is nihil asserunt, which
