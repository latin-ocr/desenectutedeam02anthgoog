the using-of armor, such as marching m arms, carrying the shield,
doc. By equos are indicated cavalry exercises3 by hasta, hurling'
the spear or javelin3 by cheam, an exercise peculiar to the tironoe,
or young soldiers, who, being armed with a⁴ shield and club instead
os a swerd, were made each to attack a stake projecting six feet
from the ground, and shower blows upou— it as upon an enemy.

or some other hard substance, and was struck with a species os bat

Cyropaedia of Xenophon was the favorite reading of Scipio Africa-
nus the younger, so that ,ut facitis is the true reading' here, not ut
sciatis, quam copiose, &e., as Corradus (Quaen, p. 353) conjectures.
—In eo libro, qui est, dcc. Tne common punctuation, uamely, a
comma aster libro, produces an awkward asyndeton. If we remove
the comma in question, the first qui becomes subordinate to the sec-'
ond, and the construction a plain one. (Nauck, ad loc.)--OE'conond-
cus. Οἰκονομικός. This is a discourse on the management of a
