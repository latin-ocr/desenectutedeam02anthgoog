Ubi enim ictum invenias. The subjunctive is here the true reading,
and implies that it is very unlikely that such a person can be found. .
On the other hand, invenies would denote that he may, perhaps, be
found.--Hoec. Referring to such cases as are indicated by the words
iffimediately preceding—calamitatum societates. “The sharing of
others’ missortunes.”—Amicus certus, dcc. A comio iambic tri-

In re incerta. The early editions have in ge certa, a reading of no
value. The reference is to a state of things in which we are alto-
gether uncertain what to do, or in what way to avert a danger that
may be threatem'ng our lise -or fortune. The line is supposed to be
quoted from the Dulorestes of EnniuS, and to be imitated from the
Hecuba of Euripides (v. 1226, ed. Pflugk.): ἐν τοῖς κακοῖς γὰρ ἁγαθοὶ
σαφέστατα Ι piston—Hac duo. ‘⁴ These two tests.”-contemnunt.

simplicem et communem et consentientem. ‘⁴ That an individual
who is frank, and open, and of like turn os mind with ourselves.'’
simplicem is here opposed to multiplex in the succeeding sentence.
With regard to communem compare De Seneca, chap. xvii, 6 59. As
respects consentientem, compare the language of Sallust (Cat, xx.) :
“ Nam idem velle atque nolle, ea demum firma amicitia est.'’-Mult2plex
ingenium et tortuosum. “A wily and crooked turn of mind.”—-Na·
turaque consentit. ‘⁴ And does not agree in disposition.'‘- Ut ne cri-
minibus, dcc. “ That he neither be delighted with bringing charges
against a friend,” i. e., be neither capable of taking an ill-natured
satisfaction in reprehending the frailties of his friend—Quod initio
dixti. Compare chap. v., 9 18.—Haec duo tenere. “ To hold to these
two principles of action.’'-Ingenui. “Of a manly spirit.’'—Qu0,m
fronte occultare sententiam. “ Than to strive to hide one’s real sen-
timenta under a smooth brow.” Literally, “ by means of the broW.”
—Aliquid ab amico esse violatum. ‘⁴ Tha some rule of amity bas
been violated by a friend.”--Tristitia autem et in omni re severitas,
dic. “ Gloom, however, and severity on every occasion have each,
indeed, an air of gravity thrown around it‚” i. e., are each proper

enough for a person of grave character. Observe here what gram· ·-
