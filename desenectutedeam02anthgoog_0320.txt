the account of Plutarch. Crassus lost his son in„ the battle, and
‘endeavored to encourage the soldiers under a calamity which, he
said, concerned him alone. He talked to them os honor and their
country; but the faint and languid shout with which they responded
to his hamingus, attested their dejection. When ni'ght came on the
Parthians retired‚ it being contrary to their custom to pass the
night near an enemy, because they never, fortified their campe, and
because their horsea and arrows could be of little use in the dark.
In this miserable state of affairs, Octavius and Cassius found Cras-
sus lying upon the ground, as if he were stunned and senseless. ’
They held a couneil of war, and determinet! to retreat at once, leav-
ing the wounded on the field. Crassus, with such of the troops as
had strength to march, retii-ed to Chartae (the Haran of scripture),
and, on the following morning, the Parthiansentered the Roman
camp, and massacred the sick and wounded to the number of four

allowed to retire without 'molestation At the interview, a horse,
with rich trappings, was led out as a present from the king to Cras-
sus, who was forcibly placed upon the saddle. Octavius, seeing
plainly tha-t* it was the object of the Parthians to take Crassus alive,
seized the horse by the bridlel A scuflle ensued, and Crassus fell

one 013 the most disastrous in which the Romans were ever engaged
