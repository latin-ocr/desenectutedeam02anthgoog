M. TULLII CICERONIS PARADOXA, dec. ‘⁴ The Paradoxa
of M. Tullius Cicero, addressed to Marcus Brutus.” The Brutus
here referred to is the celebrated Marcus Junius Brutus who con-
spired against Julius Caesar.

Under this title of Paradoxa are comprehendedpix savorite para·
doxes of the Stoice, explained in familiar lenguage, defended by
popular arguments, and illustrated, occasionally, by examples de·-
rived from contemporary history, by which means they are made
the vehicles for covert attacks upon Crassus, Hortensius, and Lu-
cullus, and for ¹vehement declamation against Clodius. This must
net be viewed as a serious work, or one which the author viewed
in any other light than that of a mere jeu d’esprit (⁶⁴ Ego vero, illa
ipsa, quoe vix in gymnasiis et in otio Stoici probant, ludens conjeci in
communes locos,” praefi), sor the propositions are mere philosophica}
quibbles, and the arguments by which they are supported are pal-
pably unsatisfactory and illogical, resolving themselves into a juggle
with words, or into induction testing upon one or two particular
cases. The theorems enunciated for demonstrationi are, 1. That
which is morany fair (τὸ καλόν) is alone good (ἀγαθόν). 2. Virtue
alone is requisito to secure happiness. 8. Good and evil deeds ad-
mit of no degree, i. 6., all crimes are equally heincus, all virtueus
actions equally meritorious. 4. Every sool is a madman. 5. The

ι wise man alone is free, and, therefore, every man not wise is a

slave. 6. The wise man alone is rich.

The preface, which is addressed to M. Brutus, must have been
written early in Re. 463 for Cato is spoken of in such terme that
we can not doubt that he was still alive, or, at all events, that in-
telligence of his fate had not yet reached Italy; and there is also a
distinct allusion to the De Glaris Orasmbm as already published.
But, although the offering now presented is called a ⁴· parvum opus-
culum,” the result of studies prosecuted during the shorter nights
