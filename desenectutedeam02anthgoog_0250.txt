Nam quibusdam, quor audio, &c- The philosophare here referred
to are probably the Epicuream. A similar sentiment ia expressed
in ·the Hippolytus of Euripides (v. 253, seqq), but there the poet
evidently means it as a mere pieoe os Souratie irony. The Stoie
Chrysippus, who filled his writings with quotations from Euripides
and Homer, and who very probably cited this very passage of the
Hippolytus in his work περὶ φιλίας, is thought by Valckenaer to be
hereoopiedby Cicero. (ναίει, Βίαν-ἰὰ, p. 28, uqa—Quod illi non
persequantur tuis argutiis.. ⁴⁸ Which that uation do not hunt aster
with their sophistical subtleties.”—Nimiu amicitias? ‘⁴ Strong
friendships.'’ We must not refer nimias here to number, but merely
to quality. Cicero's nimiae amicitie are (lireotly the reverse of the
μέτριαι φιλίαι of Euripides, in the passage of the Hippolytus abore

is horrowed from a part os the passage of Euripides already referred
to, hemely, τὸ δ’ύπὲρ δισσῶν μίαν ὠδίνειν 1 ψυχὴν ’χαλεπὸν βάρος.
