These words are bracketed by some editors as out'os place here 3
but without any necessity, since they are purposely introduced to
explain and amplify what precedes. For it was a maxim of some

forming the metre'of the elegy. The common reading is elogium,
which, though retained by almost all editors, is manifestly errone-
