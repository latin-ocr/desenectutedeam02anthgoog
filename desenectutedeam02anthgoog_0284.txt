PARADOXON [ΙΙ.

ᾁ 20.
AEqualia esse peccata, dcc. ‘⁸ That all crimes are equal, and (also
311) virtuous actions,” i. e„ that good and evil deeds admit of no de-
gree, that is, all crimes are equally hemona, and all virtuous actions
equally meritorious. This same Stoic paradox is handled in the De
Em, 111., 9, 323 10, 343 14, 45; 15, 48; iv„ 2⁷, 75, dcc. Compare
Horat„ Sat„ i., 8, 75, seqq-Rerum comm. “By the issue,” i. e.‚

by their effecte. The reasoning os Cicero is this: When you com- .

mit a fault, neither the object nor the effecte of your fault are at all
to be taken into consideration, but simply the fault itself, and the
fact of your conduct being criminal. Hence it follows that all faults
are equal in genere, though they may differ greatly in specim—Ipsum
illud peccare. consult Zumpt, ὁ baa—Quoquo verteris. The mean·
ing is, whether you say it was done through imprudenee, or through
want os sels-controL—Aam' navem evertat gubernator, dcc. ¹⁴ whether
3 pilot lose a ship laden with gold-or with hay, makes a consider-
able difference 33 regards the nature of the damage, none as regards
the pilot’s unskilsulness.'’-Lapsa est libido. ‘⁶ Pession has gone
astray,” ι’. 3., 311 outrage has been committed. —Dolor. ‘⁴ The
trouble consequent upon this.”—Ese tamquam transilire lineas. ‘⁸ Is,
as it were, overleaping certain limits.” The Stoice represented
virtue as a straight line, on either side of which men fell into vice.

Quod autem non licet, dre. ‘⁶ What, however, is unlawsul, is made
to depend merely on the following circumstance, if it be shown,
namely, to be unlawful‚” i. e., it is merely sufficient to know wheth-
er a thing be unlawfiil; any question about the degree os ⁸unlawful-
nese is foreign to the subject—Id. Referring to the simple fact os
an action’s being unlawful. This unlawsulness can not be rendered
on any occasion either greater or less ; that is, sor example, it is no
more allowed you to kin a mere sti-anger, than another his own sa·
then—Quoniam in eo est peccatum, dcc. ‘⁴ Since the fault consists
in this, in the fact os the thing's not being lawful, which fact is ·
always one and the same.”

Quod si virtutes, dcc. “Again, if virtues‚” &ce-Nec bono viro
meliorem, διο. “And that a man can not be made better than a
good man,” dno„ i. e., that there is no better man than a good man.
