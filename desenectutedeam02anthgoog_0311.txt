honor, and Crassus with gold. The ruling passion os Crassus was
avarice3 and, to repair and increase the fortunes of his family, he
was willing to submit to servile dependence, to encounter any risk,
and undergo any hardship. He undertook a service of considerable
danger in levying troops sor Sulla among the Marsi, and he aster·
ward (Β.Ο. 83) distinguished himself in a successful campaign in
Umbria. He was personally brave, and by fighting against the
remains of the Marian fection he was aveuging the πνους, os his
house. Sulla put him in mind of this, and rewarded him by dona·
tions of confiscated property, or by allowing him to purchase, at an
almost nominal valae, the estates of those that were proscribed.
