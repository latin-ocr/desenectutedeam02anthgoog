es and good offices.”-—Similitudo. ‘⁴ A similarity of character.”-·
Quasi propinquitate conjunctos. atque natura. ‘⁴ As is united by the
ties os blood and natural relationship.”-—Nikil appetentius similium
sui, dcc. ‘⁸ Nothing more eager aster things resembling itsels, noth-
ing more prone to seize upon such.” Observe here the employment
of the genitive with similis to denote internal resemblance—Bonis
1 inter bonos, dcc. ⁴⁴ That there exists for the good among one another
a sort of necessary feeling of good-will.’'-—Sed eadem bonitas etiam,
&o ‘⁸ This same good feeling, however, extends likewise to all
classes of society,” i. e.‚ a good man’s benevolence, however, is
not confined merely to the good, but is extended to every individual. .
-Νἲηι ωε enim inhumana, dne. ⁴⁸ For virtue is not at variance with
the better feelings os our nature, neither does she exempt herself
from the discharge os human (luties, nor is she haughty in charac-
ter.” The expression inhumana is equivalent to nihil humanum sen-
tiens, and directly opposed to the well-known expression of Ter-
ence, ‘⁴ nihil humani a se alienum putam.” (Heaut., i., 1, 25.) The
term immunis, again, has the force here of inofficiosa, or, as Klotz
’ explains it, ‘⁸ quae vult esse vacua a munere gratiarum atque benevolen-
τίω Ρνωεεαπᾱο.” The reading immanis, “unkind,” which Ernesti,
Wetzel, and others adopt, is decidedly inferior. (Compare Seyffert,
ad loc.)—Si a caritate vulgi abhorreret. ⁴⁸ Is it were to shrink from
any feeling of affection for mankind at large.”

Qui utilitatis causa fingunt amicitias. ‘⁴ Who form unto them-
selves an idea os friendships entered into for mere utility’s sake.”
Observe that fingunt is here equivalent to animo fingunt, and con-

The idea is, that it is not so much the benefits received astrue as-
sectionate zeal from which they flow that gives them their best and
most valuable commendation.— Cum studio. “ Accompanied by a
with for our welsare.”—Tantumque abest. ‘⁶ And so far is it from
being the feast—Atque haud scio, an, dcc. “ Perhaps, however, it
may not, indeed, be absolutely needful that nothing be'ever at all
wanting to friends,” i. e., perhaps, however, it may admit os a ques-
tion whether one’s friend should be so absolutely sufficient sor him·
sels as not to need the aid of others. With regard to haud scio an,
compare Zumpt, ὑ 721.-U'bi enim studia nostra viguissent. “For
in what way could my zeal for his welfare have been able to dis-
play itself in all its vigorl'’ Seyffert refers studia nostra to both
Laelius and Scipio; but this appears to be at varianoe with opera
nostra immediately succeeding.
