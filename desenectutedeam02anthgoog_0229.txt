CHAPTER. 11.

Sunt ista, Lali! “ These things which you remark, Laelius, are ’
even so‚” i. e., what you remark, Laelius, is perfectly correct. Ob-
serve, again, the peculiar force of ista, as referring· to the person
spoken to. Literally, ⁴⁶ those things of yours, Laelius. are so.” The
common text supplies vera, but this is wanting in the best MSS„
and is already implied in eunt. Compare the Greek ἔστι ταῦτα.-
—Sed existimare debes. Laelius must be supposed to have remarked
to Fannius and Mucius that he regarded the death of Africanus as
an irreparable loss to the state, an idea which Fannius seeks to dis-
countenance, hy maintaining that Laelius himself is the very man
to supply his place, and that, too, in the opinion of all.—Appellant.
Alluding to his sumame of Sapiens, ‘⁴ the Wise,” or “ the ‘Prudent‚”
which, it seems, he had specially received for his forbearance when
tribune, in desisting from the attempt to procare a re-division of
the state demesnes, and which surname his subsequent career, both “
in public and private, had fully confirmed—Hoc. ⁸⁸ This same dis·
tinction.”—Modo. “In late years.” The allusion is to Cato the
Censor, who died in his eighty-fisth year, ΒΩ. 149, and, consequently,
twenty years before the present conversation is supposed to have
taken place. Hence we see that modo, like nuper, mox, and proxime,
may be made to refer to a considerable interval of time. (Compare
Hearing„ De Off„ ii„ 21, 75.)—L. Atilium. L. Atilius, a Roman ju·
rist, who received his title of Sapiens from his knowledge of the
Roman IaW‚ and was the first individual on whom the people be-
stowed that appellation. He is supposed to have lived in the middle
of the sixth century os the city. Atilius wrote commentarios on the
laws of the Twelve Tables. (Cia, De Lag„ ii„ 233 Heineoe„ Hice.

Jur. Rom, ὁ 125.)

Prudens injure civili. ‘⁴ Wise in our civil code,” i. e., in Roman
law—Multarum rerum usum. ‘⁶ A profound experience in many
things,” i. e., a profound experience in the affairs of the world—Pro-
visa prudenter. ‘⁸ Arranged with wisc foresight.” The reference
is to mensures indicating great political foresight.—Gonstanter.
“ With manly fimness.”—Propterea jam. ‘⁴ On this account, at
length.” Jam must not be referred here to senectute, but regarded
as marking gradation. (Compare Hand, ad Tur-cell„ iii„ p. 117.)—
Te autem. ⁴⁴ They think that you, however.” supply existimant.
In strictness, however, the accusative with the infinitive here de-
