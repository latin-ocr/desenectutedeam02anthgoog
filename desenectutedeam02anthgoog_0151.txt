(Consult notes on the title of this work.)-Apud quem. Scipio and
Laelius a're here supposed to have paid him a visit, and the scene
of the conversation is his own residence.—Scipionem. The younger
Africanus, called Scipio AEmilianus. He was the son of Paulus*
AEmilius‚ the conqueror of Macedonia, and was adopted by the son
of Scipio Africanus the elder. 1t was this younger Africanus that
destroyed Cart-hage Rc. 146, about four years after the date of the
present conversation. The Laelius here mentioned in conjunction
with him was C. Laelius Sapiens, son of the elder Laelius. His in-
timacy with Africanus the younger was as remarkable as his father’s
friendship with the elder, and it obtained an imperishable monument
in Cicero’s treatise, entitled “ Loelius, sive De Amicitia.” As Laelius
was the elder of the two, he is named before Scipio in the text.

the origins of the Italian towns and comumnes—Grecis literis.

Cum hoc Ο. Loelio. ‘⁴ With Gaius Laelius here.” Observe that
the pronoun hic is used of objecta which are nearest to the speaker,
whereas more distant ones are referred to by ille—Ceterarum rc-
rum. Equivalent to quod attinet ad ceteras res. An imitation of the
Greek idiom. (Compare Zumpt, §4³7, note 1.)-Onus AEtna gravius.
Compare Euripides, Herc. Fur.,·637, τὸ γῆρας ἀεὶ βαρύτερον Ali-vac
σκοπέλων. The allusion is to the giants wh0, according to the
poets, lay buried beneath AEtna‚ with the whole mass of the mount·
ain pressing upon them. There, for example, lay Enceladus, ac-
cording to Virgil (En, iii„ 578„ Typhoeus, according to Pindar
