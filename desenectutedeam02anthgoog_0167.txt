less, more likely to be the true one, from its being the more difficult
and unusual reading, and it is easily susceptible os defence from
Off„ i.‚ 25, 87, as well as from other passages of Cicero cited hy
Gernhard. The plainer and clearer form of expression, however,
would undoubtedly be similiterque faciunt, ut, si qui, dne—Ille autem.
The pilot, or steersman, is meant. Ernesti maintains that ipse is
the true reading, not ille, because it is opposed to alii. But Cicero
would only have written ipse, is he had meant the pilot to he re·
garded as exercising authority over the rest. Illa, therefore, must
not be disturbed. The case, however, is different with regal-d to
mem, which appears quite superfluous, and which we have, there·
fore, included within brackets, as Orelli has done.

Aut eomitatibus, aut celeritate corporum. The term velocitas means
merely “swistness,” such as is seen in running; celeritas, on the
contrary, is ‘⁴ agility.” (Gernkard, ad loc.) The plural, velocitatibus,
is peculial· ; but still we ought not to think it any stranger than for-
titudines, in Off, i.‚ 22, or tarditates and cela-itam in Off, i.‚ 36.
consult, also, Zumpt, 4 fla—corporum. Not corpor-ic, because the
reference is to many, who act in obedience to the orders os a single
individual, as, for example, soldiers obeying a commander; and
“the authority exercised by the one over the many is indicated hy
the words consilio, auctoritate, &c.-Sementia. ‘⁴ By the giving of
directions.” Compare Gernhard: ‘⁴ Sententia est ejus, qui, quid fieri
oporteat, aperte dicit 3⁹⁹ and also Billerbeck: ‘⁴ Sententia, der Aus-
epruclt Deum, der da hermeagt Was gualtelmi 'nactast’ In Gaza’s
Greek version it is incorrectly rendered by άξιῶματι.

Qui et miles, dte. Compare chap. 1„ θ 32.-Οωεανα. “Το lead
an idle life‚” i. e., to be a useless and idle member of the state.—
Quae sint gerenda. ‘⁴ What ones are to be waged,” i. e., quoe bella
sint gerenda, not ea (negotia) quae siut gerenda, as Gernhard explains
it, and which Orelli very properly condemns. Nauck maintains
that we must read sunt, as Gernhard and others give it; but Orelli,
Madvig, dte, have sine, which is undoubtedly the more' correct
reading—Male cogitanti. ⁴⁸ cherishing hostile intentions.’' Parti-
cipial construction, for quoe male jam diu cogitat—Bellum multo ante
denuntio. An allusion to the well-known story of Cato’s “ Delenda
est Carthagoe’ It was a most unwise policy on his part to urge the
destruction of this celebrated city, since, so long as Rome had to be
on her guard against a rival republic, his sellim-citizens would he

under a usesul restraint, and he prevented from abandoning them·
