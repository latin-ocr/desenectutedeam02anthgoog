selves to frivolous and reckless passione, and haughty insolence.—·
Quam illam excisam esee cognovero. Cato did not live to see the'ful·
fillment os what he so eagerly desired, but died three years before
the overthrow of Carthage‚ Rc. 149. (Vult. Pac, i., 13, l.)

Quam palmam, dcc. Compare with this the account given in
Βία, Epic„ 49, that when Cato heard of the exploit of the younger '
Scipio, who was then serving as a‘ tribune os the soldiers, in having
saved the Roman army by his prudence and resolution, he declar-ed
in the Roman senate, “ reliquos, qui in Africa militarent, umbra-5 mil·
itare, Scipionem vigere.'’— Ue avi reliquias persequare. “ That you
may follow out what was left unfinished by your grandsire,” i. e„
may complete the work which he so happily began, and lay Car-
thage in the dust. The younger Scipio, as before remarked, was a
son of L. AEmilius Paulus, but was adopted into the Scipio family
by the son os the elder Africanus ; the latter, therefore, is here styled
his gramana—Tertius hic et tricesimus, dcc. Many editors read
quintus here ; but we have retained the common lection, with Madvig
and Orelli. The change would probably be a correct one, could we
be certain with regard to the system os chronological computation
which Cicero has followed—Sed memoriam illius viri, dcc. It sou nds
strangely to hear Cato always speaking in terma of high eulogy of
the elder Africanus, against whom, according to Plutarch and other
writers, he cherished feeling-s osso unsriendly a nature. ⁸

Novem annis. , Here, again, a correction is made of decem for no-
vem, by those editors who have written above quintu-5 for tertius.
The same remark will apply to this emendation as above given.
—Excursiones “Running forth.” A military exercise is meant,
which was especially used in the training os light troops, and con-
sisted in sallying forth as if to meet a soe. Compare Cic„ de Dicin„
ll, 10: ‘⁴ Sed haec fuerit nobis, tamquam levis armaturoe, pri-ma orati·
onis excursio ,·” which passage will also afford a sufficient answer to
Gruter’s proposed reading os decursione—Saltu. 0‘ Leaping.” Put
here for the actus agendi. Another military exercise is meant, which
was performed most commonly in armor, in order to train the soldier
sor leaping trenches‚ springing upon the soe, dte—Qum nisi essent.
‘⁴ For had not these qualities existed.” (Zumpt, ᾴ 803.)-Senatum.
A senate in the early times was always regarded as an assembly

os elders, which ie, in fact, the meaning os the Roman sanatae, as of
the Spartan γερουσία. ”
