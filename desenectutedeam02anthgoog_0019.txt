PREFAOE.

 

’ Tar.. treatises of Cicero on Old Age and Friendship
have long formed a favorite course os reading in
many of our colleges, and are well deserving of such

„ a distinction. They are here presented in a form

which, it is hoped, will render them still more attract-
ive and useful than they have hitherto proved. To
these two treatises are appended the Paradoxa and
Somnium Scipionis of the same writer, and the life of
Atticus by Cornelius Nepos3 the whole forming a
text-book for Latin recitations which, it is conceived,
will be found well adapted sor the younger classes in
our collegiate institutionS.

The notes have been prepared with a direct view
to utility, and to the removing of those difficulties
which so often embarrass and discourage the student,
and drive him, in the absence of better aids, to the

mischievous use of badly-executed translations. The ⁸

success which has attended the editor’s efforts in in-
troducing this system of annotation on the ancient
writers is extremely gratifying to him3 nor less grat-
ifying is the fact that many, who were loud in their
opposition to extended commentarios, are now so con·
vinced of the superior advantages of these as to have
adopted them, in several instanceS, in their own works.
It is to be hoped, for the sake of American scholar-
ship, that the practice will become still more general.

The materials for the notes have been obtained
from the best sources, among which the following
