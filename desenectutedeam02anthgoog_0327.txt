Reliqui coelitaee. ‘⁸ Ye other heavenly ones.” The reference is ιο
the stara, and more particularly the plancis, which were ranked by
many of the barbarons natione of antiquity in the number of the
gods. (Compare Luceant„ ii., 5.)--cmup··eio in meo regno. Cicero
deviates here from „the ordinary historical account, according to
which, Scipio AEmilianus had already, before this, met with Masi-
nissa in his kingdom. He appears to have gone to Masinissa three
times: first, when sen't by Lucullus, whose lientenant he then was
in Spain, to procui-e elephanta and re·enforcements‚ on which oc-
casion he witnessed the condiet betan Masinissa and Hasdrubal ς
secondly, on the present occasion (supposing that this actually oc-
curred); and thirdly, when Masinissa, on his death-bed, sent for
Scipio, then sarving in Africa as militar-y tribune. The monareh,
however, expired before his arrival, leaving it to the young officer
to settle the affairs of his kingdom-Illius optiva atque invictissimi
viri. Referring to the elder P. Cornelius Scipio, whom the younger,
now present, recalled in name—Percontatus est. A distinction to
the following effect has been suggested between interrogare and
percontari, namely, that interrogare is used in questions where tha
answer may be simply Yet or No ,- whereas percontari always re-
quires a detailed repis. Compap the distinction in Greek between
ἐρωτᾶν and πννθάιεεσθαι. (Grombie, Gymnas„ ii, p. 42.)

such a result in sleep aa ,that which Ennius states with regard to
Homer.” Ennius, in the commencement of his Annals, had spoken
of the vision which shewed him in a dream the image of Homer:
‘⁶ In somnis milti vim Homerus adesse poeta,” aa the line is quoted
