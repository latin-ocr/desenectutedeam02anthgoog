“ With any view to the futurem-Sensim. ⁸⁸ By·and-by.” This is
the explanation os Kappe, “ nach und nach.’' Heusinger, less cor·
rectly, explains it by clanculum—Parum. ⁴· Not sufficientlyfi—sm·
judieii. ⁴⁴ Adhering to the dictatos oshis own judgment.” Observe
the peculier construction of the genitive, and compare the explana·

tion of Fischer: ⁴⁶ Qui nuum judicium noa aliorum ineerta opiniones

sequebatur?

CHAPTER. X.

Aa adventum imperatorum. ‘⁶ On the arrival of the leadern.” The
triumviri are meant, namely‚ Lepidus, Antony, and Octavianus.
(Compare Morus, iv., 6.)-De foro decesserat. The meaning is that
he no longer appeared in public, or occupied himself with business
os any kind—Fastigio. “ Elevation.” Observa that periculo, which
follows, is not in literal opposition to this, but that the opposition is
marked more by the sense and spirit os the term—Equalem εἰπιόἱ·
limumque sui. ‘⁶ Of the same age, and very closely resembling him
in character.”-In ludo. ⁴⁴ At school.” The full form os expression
is ludo literarum, or ludo literaria—Ferebatur. Much stronger than
the simple erat would h'ave been—Attici officii. ⁴⁴ Of the kind offi-
ces os Atticus.”—Statimque. For sed ut statim, a mode of con-
struction by no means uncommon in the case of qua—Quod noctu
fiebat. ⁶⁶ Since all this happened during the night.”——Sed conjunc-

tim. “But always for that of another in connection with his ποθ’ 1

—Nullam sejunctam eibi, dac. ‘⁶ No fortune (of whatever kind) to
be set apart sor him by that individual.” Observa that eo refers
back to quoquam. The meaning is that he did not wish to be sepa-
rated stom a friend under any aspect os fortune—Hieme. ·“ The
wintery storm.”

GHAPTER XI .

Se emersit. The conjecture of Lambinus. The more usual em·-

ployment ·ot' emerge is as a neuter verb. It occurs, however,
transitively, in Cicero also (De ΗΜ. Resp„ 8³), and Terence
(And, iii.. 3, 30). There is no need, therefore, of reading ipse here
in place of ee—Praemiis. Equivalent to propter prmia.-- Conquire-
· ret. ⁴⁴ Were searching anast—Epirum. Atticus, as before re-
marked‚ bad an estate in this country, near Buthrotum—Qui etiam.
‘⁸ Nay‚ he even.”
