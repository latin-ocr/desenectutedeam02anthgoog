mliorem. ‘⁴ More fatal,” i. a, carrying with it more imininent dan-
ger to life (caput).—-C'ujue voluptatis avidoe libidines. “The eager
appetite for which pleasure.” Compare Pacciolati: ‘⁴ Avida libidi-

’ nes .· ita appellantur vehementiores appetitus et cupiditates.”—Ad ’

potiundam. ‘⁴ To its enjoyment.'’--Incitarentur. The subjunctive
is used because the language and sentimenta of another are quoted.

clandestina colloquia. ‘⁴ clandestine eonferences,” i. a, secret
correspondence with intent to betray one’s country—Nullum malum
facinus. ‘¹ No evil deed.” Observe that facinus (from facio) means
any act or proceeding from which important consequences follow,
whether it be good or bad. Hence the addition here os the epithet
malum, to give a more definito meaning to the noun.-Impelleret.
The subjunctive again, like incitarentur in ο ila—Nisi voluptatis.
Gruter suspected that these words were a mere gloss ; incorrectly,
however, since voluptatis is meant to be an emphatic term, as indi-
cating the parent source of so many evils, and therefore requires
repetition. The same remark will apply to voluptatem in the suc-
ceeding section—Muneri ac dono. ‘⁶ Gist and favor.” Compare the
Greek version, δώρῳ τε καὶ χαρίσματι. The distinction between mu-
nus and donum appears to be this: munus is a present which usage
or obligation requires, whereas donum is purely a present, no obli·
gation being implied on the part of the giver. In the present in-
stance, therefore, the mind is termed munuc, because it is the ac·
customed gist of the deity to man; and it is, at the same time, also
rightly called donum, because it is a free-will gist, or, in other words,
a favor. (compare Grombie, Quaedam, vol. i.‚ p. 115.)

Libidine dominante. ‘⁴ When appetite rules supremam-Tempe-
rantioe. Equivalent to continentia, or the Greek &arpenta—Comi& ι
tere. ⁸⁶ To obtain a firm soothold.’'—Aliquem. Depending on fingere.
Is placed after this verb, or aster animo, it would have given rise to
ambiguity, on account of the nearness of jubebat, which might have
seemed to govern it..--Qu.anta percipi posset maxima. “As great
a one as could possibly be conceived.” Supply mente aster percipi,
and observe the peculiar construction of the superlative (mxima)
with quanta, where the latter supplies the place of quam. Consult
Zumpt, ο 689, where other examples ane cited—Tamdiu, dum. A
pleonastic form of expression, not unfrequent in Cicero. consult
Gernhard, ad loc„ and the numerous passages cited by Scheller, and
