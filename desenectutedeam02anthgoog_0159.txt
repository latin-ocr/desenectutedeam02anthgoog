praise of Fabius Maximus, which occurred in the twelsth book of his
Annals. We siud them quoted again by Cicero in his treatise De
Officiis, i.‚ 71, and referred* to by several other writers. Virgil has
imitated them in part in his AEneid (vi, 84o):

‘⁸ TinMaoeimus ille es,
Unus qui nobis cunctando restituis rem.”

Livy also remarks (xxx.‚ 26): ‘⁶ Sic nihil cercius est, quam unum
hominem nohis cunctando rem renituisse, sicut Ennius ait.'’ Compare
Column. ad Emi„ Fragm„ p. 98.

cunctando. An allusion to the surname Cunctator, given to Fa-
bius on account of his cautious aud wiseodelay in carrying on the
war against Hannibal—Restituit rem. ‘⁴ Restored the state.” Rem
for rempublicam. The military talents of Fabius were not, perbapS,
of the highest order, but he understood beyond all his contempora-
ries the nature of tho struggle, the genius of Hannibal, and the dis-
position of bis own countrymen. Cicero says truly of him (Rep., i.‚
1), ‘⁴ Bellum Punicum secundum enervavit,’' a more appropriate eulogy
than this of Ennius, since Marcellus and Scipio restored the repub-
}ic to its military eminence‚ whereas Fabius made it capable of res·
toration. (Smith, Dict. Biogr„ p. 993.)-N0n enim rumores, dte.
“For he placed not disparaging reporta before the safety of his
country,’' i. a, he went on steadily pursuing his plans for the safety
of his country, and disregarded all the secret rumors and disparag·
ing reports which were circulated concerning him, and which as-
cribed his dilatory movements to cowardice. Observe that the prose
form of expression would be non enim rumores anteponebat saluti.—
Ergo postque magisque, dte. The idea is this τ Ergo ct post obitum
viri gloria claruit, et magis etiam Mc atate claret, quam quum viveret.

§11-

Tarentum ωηο, dcc. Tarentum was taken by treachery, as both
Livy and Plutarch inform us. Either, therefore, Cato is made to re-
fer here to some other account of its capture, or else, though the
place was recovered from the Carthagiuians in the way just men·
tioned, there was room, nevertheleSS, sor the exercise of “ vigilan-
ἐᾶθ’ and “consilium.”-Salinatori. There is an error here on the
part of Cicero. The Livius who commanded the citadel of Taren-
tum was M. Livius Macatus (Lim, xxvii„ 253 Plut„ Vit. Fab., 23),
not Ο. Livius Salinator. The same error occurs in the De Orat, ii„
67, 273.—Mea opera. After the town had been taken by the Car-
thaginians, he had fled for refuge into the citadel, which he main-
tained notwithstanding all the attempta of Hannibal to dislodge him.
