was brought forw'ard by the tribune Fabricius, Clodius appeared
with an a‘rmed body of slaves and gladiators3 Fabricius had also
brought armed men to support him, and a bloody fight ensued, in
which the party of Fabricius was worstsd. Soon 'arteman-d, Clo-
dius with his men fell upon another of his opponente, the tribune
Sextius, who nearly lost his life in the stay. He attacked the house
of Milo, another of the tribunes, and threatened-*his life whenever
he appeared. He set fite to the Temple of the Nympha, for the
purpose of destroying the censorial records3 intel-rupted the Apol-
linarian gamos, which were being celebrated by the praetor, L. Ce-
cilius, and besieged him in his house. Milo made aa unsuccessful
attempt to bring Clodius to trial sor his acts of violence, and, find·
ing his endeavors unsuccessful, resolved to repel force by force.
Accordingly, he collected an anned band of slaves and gladiatore,

The decree by which Cicero was recalled provided also sor the ”
restitution of his property. Some difficulty, however, remained
with respect to the house on the Palatine‚ the site -of which had ²
been consecrated by Clodius to the service of religion. The matter

’ was referred to the college of pontifices, but was not decided till

the end of September, when Cicero defended his right before them.
The, pontifices returned an answer sufficient to satisfy all religione
scruples, though Clodius chose to take it as 'favorable to himself,
and the senate decreed the restoration of the site, and the payment
