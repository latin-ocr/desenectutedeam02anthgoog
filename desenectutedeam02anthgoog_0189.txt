striking metaphor. The allurements of pleasure are like the bright

was in B.C. 184. On the Latin idiom, feci ut ejicerem, consult
Zumpt, o Gla—Notandum lihidinem. ‘⁸ That profligaey ought to have
a mark set upon it,” i. e.‚ ought to be stigmatized by the nota cemo-
n'a‚ or censor's mark. And yet, such was already the -low state of
morals at Rome, that a mob could be procui-ed to invite the de-
graded wretch to resume his former place at the theatre in the scats
allotted to the consulare. (Lac, xxxix„ 42, seq. ‚· Plut„ Cat. Maj.,
17.)-Quum esset consul in Gallia. We have placed a comma aster
Gallia, in accordance with the suggestion os Nauck. The common
punctuation is cum essee consul, in Gallia exoratus in, dcc. By Gal-
lia is here meant Gallia Cisalpina, or Nox-thern Italy.

Exoratus in convivio a scorto est. ‘⁴ Was prevailed upon at a ban-
quet by the solicitations os a vile minion of his.”—Aliquem eorum,
oze. Livy says that the victim of his cruelty was a Boian of high
rank, who had· come with his children to solicit the protection os
the consul—Censore. Titus Flamininus was chosen censorin ΒΩ.

Cato to transplant his ambition to the fitter soil and ampler field of
Rome—Perdita. ‘⁴ Abandoned.”— Quoe scum probro privato, dcc.
‘⁸ Since it united with private insamy the disgrace os the highest
military office,” i. e.‚ the consulship. Observe, again, the employ-
ment os the subjunctive with the relative, because the latter assigns
the reason or motive.
