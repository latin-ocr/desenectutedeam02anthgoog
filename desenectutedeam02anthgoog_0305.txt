his house on the Palatino, ‘and destroyed his villas at Tusculum and‘
Formiae. The greater part of the property carried off from them
was divided between the two consuls. The ground on which the
Palatino house stood, with such of the property as still remained,
was put up to auction. Clodius wished ιο become the purchaser
os it, and, not liking to bid himself, got a needy sellow named Scato
to bid for him. He wished to erect on the Palatine a palace of sur-
passing size and magnificence. A short time before this, he had
purchased the house of Q. Seius Postumus, after poisoning the
owner, who had refused to sell it. This it was his intention to
unite with another house which he already had there. He pulled
down the portico of Catulus, which adjoined Cicem’s grounds, and
erected another in its place with his own name inscribed on it. To
alienate Cicero‘s property irretrievably, he dedicated it to the god-
dess Libertas, aud a small portion of the site of the dwelling, with
part of the ground on which the portico of Catulus had stood, was*
occupied by a chapel ιο the goddess? For the image of the goddess
he made use of the statue of a Tanagrean hetoera, which his brother
Appius had brought from Greece. To maintain the armed hands
whom he employed, Clodius required large sums of money3 but
this he did not find much difficulty in procuring: for with the pop·
ulace he was all-powerful, and his influence made his favor worth
purchasing. He went so far as to offend Pompey by aiding the
escape of Tigranes, son os the king of Armenia, whom Pompey had
brought a prisoner to Rome. In this instance his services were
purchased. Pompey, however, did not feel himself strong enough
ιο resent the insult. Clodius soon assailed him more openly. The
consul Gabinius sided with Pompey, Frequent conflicta took place
between the armed band of the tribune and the consul, in one of
which Gabinius himself was wounded and his fasces broken. Clo-
dius and the tribune Ninnius went through the farce of dedicating
to the gods,‘the one the property of Gabinius, the other that of Clo-
dius. , An attempt was made by Clodius, through one of his slaveS, “
upon the life of Pompey, who now withdrew to his own house, and
kept there as long as his enemy was in office. Clodius stationed a
body of men, under his freedman Darnis, to watch him, and the
praetor Flavius was repulsed in an attempt to drive them off.

The attempta made before the end of this year to procure the re-
call of‘Cicero proved abortive. Next year, B.C. 57, Clodius, pos-
sessing no longer tribunitial power, was obliged to depend on his
armed hands for preventing the people from passing a decree to re-
call Cicero. On the 25th of January‚ when a rogation to that effect
