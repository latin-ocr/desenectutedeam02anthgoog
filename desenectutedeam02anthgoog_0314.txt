that would have ensued.

In the whole intercourse between Crassus and Cicero may be
observed a real coldness, with occasional alternatione of affected
friendship. In his intercourse with others, Crassus was equally un·-
steady in his likings and enmities. They were, in fact, not deeply
seated, and, without the practice of much hypocrisy, could be as-
sumed or withdrawn, as temporary expediency might suggest. It
was from motives of sels-interest, without actual community os seel-
ing or purpose, that the so-oalled triumvir-ate was formed between
Caesar, Pompey, and Crassus. Each hoped to gain the first placo
for himself by using the others sor his purpose& though there can
be no doubt that the consedet-acy was really most profitable to
Oaesar, and that, of the three, Crassus would have been the least
able tb rule alone. Coesar had already found Crassus a convenient
friend3 for in B.G. ⁶1, when Coesar was ‚about to proceed to his
province in Fui-ther Spain, Crassus became security for his debts to
a large amount. It may, at first view, excite surprise, that a person
os so little independent greatuess as Crassus should have occupied
the position that he filled, and that men of wider capacity should
· have entered into a compact to share with him the honors and prof-
its of the commonwealth. But the fact is to be accounted for by
considering that the character of Crassus represented, in many
points, a large portion os the public. While the young, the (lating,
and the ambitione, the needy, therevolutionary, and the democratie,
adhered to Caesar—-while the aristocracy, the party of the old con·
stitution, those who affected the reputation os high principle and
steady virtue, looked with greater favor upon Pompey-there was
a considerable mass ef plain, moderate, practica] men, who saw
much that they liked in Crassus. ’ Independently of the actual in-
fluence which he acquioed by the means we have explained, he had
the sympathy os those who, without being noble, were Jealous of
the nobility, and were rich, or were occupied in making money.
They sympathized with him because the love of gain was a strong
trait in the Roman character, and they saw that his unequivocal
success in his parauit was a proof of at least one unquestionable
taient—a taient os the most universal practica! utility. He was not
without lit'erary acquin-emeat, for, unde-r the teuching os the Peri-
patetic Alexander, he had gained a moderate proficiency in history
and philosophy. There was no profligacy in his private conduct to
shock decent and respectable mediocrity. He was not above ordi·
nary comprehensim. The many could appreciate a worldly and
