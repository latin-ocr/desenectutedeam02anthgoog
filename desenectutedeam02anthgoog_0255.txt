Ernesti entertaine doubts respecting dixero, and reads δέπαος but
edixere is well defended by scheller and Gernhard, who make edi-
cere here to be the same as patefacere. (Compare, also, Kritz, ad
San, Cat„ xlviii„ 4, p. 221.)-—Vocem. ‘⁸ Remark.’'-—Dixisset. The
subjunctive, because the words of the person spoken of are referred
to. (Zumpt, § 645.)-Ut si aliquando esset esurus. ⁸⁸ Asis he were
some time or other going to hate.” (Compare Aristode, Rhea, ii.,
133 where, in speaking os the old, he says, καὶ φιλοῦσιν ὡς· μισήσειν·
τες, κ. r. λ.)-Ηοσ. The saying just referred to is ascribed to Bias
by Aristotle (Rha, ii., 13), Diogenes Laertius (ἰ, 87), and others.
(Compare Menag„ ad Diog. Laerc„ l. e. )—Impuri eujusdam, dac. “ Of
some sordid wretch, or os some ambitione individual, or of one who
rasere,” dac. Loelius, or, rather, Cicero is guilty here of injustiee
’ toward Bias. The Grecian sage refers merely to ordinary acquaint-
anceS, as appears plainly from the words of Diogenes Laertius
which come immediately aster, namely, τοὺς. γὰρ πλείστους κακούς,
and also from the following: συνεόοῡλευέ τε ὦδε. Βραδὲως ἐγχείρει
τοῖς πραττομένοις· ὃ δ’ ἀν ἕλῃ, ,aetates τηρῶν διάμενε. consult Bei-
er’s note on the present passage—Necesse erit cupere et optare, dte.
This, again, is an unfair view of the maxim of Bias. He does not
mean that one is to wish that his friend may prove his enemy, and
thus afford him an opportunity for breaking ost} hut that a man must
be on his guard iu the case of ordinary acquaintances, lest auch a
“ state os things may occur. ”

Ut nequando inciperemus. ‘⁶ 'I'hat we should never begin.” Ob-

should think that any period could arrive when friendship would be ·

converted into eumity.—- Ut eum emendati, dcc. ⁴· That when the

from any defect or stain.” This, in fact, forms the first step, name-
ly, that we form connectione of friendship with men of irreproach-
able characters.— Ut etiam, si qua fortuna acciderit, dac. ‘⁴ So that,
even if it have happened by any chance that,” &e.—Declinandum sit
de via. Graevius cites, as instances of the application of this rule,
the desence of Milo by Cicero, and that of Norbanus by Antonius
the orator. (Cia, De Orat„ ii., 48, 49.)-—Modo ne summa turpitudo
sequatur. ‘⁶ Provided only the highest degree of turpitude do not

and might seem to justify the suspicion that Cicero thought the
