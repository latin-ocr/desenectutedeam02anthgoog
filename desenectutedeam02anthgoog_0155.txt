’rus ns sannorum. 133

C. Salinator. Caius Livius Salinator is meant, who was consul
ΑΗΒ, 565.. (Βία, mviii„ ὃδὴ-81). Albim. Spurius Posthu-
mus Albinus was consul A.U.c. 567, and died, while augur, in 573.
-Quod carerent. Observe the employment of the subjunctive, as
indicating merely their own sentimenta, not those of the speaker or
author. Se, a little aster, ⁴⁶ sine.quibus putarent.”—Vitam nullam.
“ That lise was of no value.’' Observe that nullam here is equiva-
lent to nullius momenti or pretii. This vita nulla is directly opposed
to the ‘⁸ vita vitalis” of Ennius (Cia, de Am„ 6).—ca12·. “To be
courted.”

Qui mihi mm id videbantur accusare, dcc. “Now these men ap-
peared to me to blame nothing of the kind that ought to have been
blamed.” Observe, in the first place, that qai here, at the begin-
ning of the sentence, is equivalent to Ιιι· autem, and consult Zumpt,
§ 8033 antl, in the next place, that id is here the same as tale.
Compare the version of Nauck: ‘⁶ uiolas von der Art, was anzaklagen
gewesen ware? The common mode of rendering the clause (⁴⁶ ap-
peared to me not to blame that which should have been blamed”)
makes Cato say that the ground of their complaint was a correct
one, but was not properly put forth! (Compare the remarks os

Nauck, in the Neue Jahrb„ 12 supp. vol„ p. 559.)—Quod esset ασσυ- x

tandum. The subjunctive is here employed, because id precedes
in the sense of tale. (Zumpt, Ο 656.)-Ι]επι venirem. ⁴⁶ Would occur
as a matter of course,” i. e., would necessarily be experienced by.
-Quorum ego multorum, dcc. “Of many of whom 1 have known
the old age to be without complaint, since they both did not take it
ill that they were released from the setters of their passions, and‚”
dcc. Ieibidinam is here, in fact, equivalent to voluptatum. Observe‚
moreover, that ¹qai takes the subjunctive here because indicating
the reason or ground of what precedes.

In moribus est ‘non in oetate. ‘⁴ Lies in the habits, not in the age
os the individua1‚” i. a, in the man, not in the age—Moderati, et
m difficiles, διε. “ Of well-regulated desires, and who are neither
morose nor churlish.” The term moderati here is less correctly
rendered by some “of moderate views.”. It rather answers‚ on
the contrary, to Plato's κόσμιοι (Βεμ, 560, D.)‚ or, as Wetzel ex-

plains it, ‘⁴ Qui a voluptatibus et cupiditatibus temperare sibi possunt.” -

—Importunicas et inhumanitas. ‘⁶ Unseasonable and churlish behav-
ior.”

influence, and ample possessions‚ and high character which you
