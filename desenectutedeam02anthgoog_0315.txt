vulgar-minded, but ease man, whose principles sat 100⁸er bnt con-
veniently upon him ; who was not likely to innovate rashly,.to daz-
zle by eccentric brilliancy‚ or to put to shame by an overstrained
rigidity of virtue. Thus, it was more prudent to combine with
Crassus as an ally, than to incur the opposition of his party, and to
risk the‘counter·influence of an enormous fortune which made the
name of Crassus proverbial sor wealth. Pliny (H. N„ xxxiii, 47)
valnes his estates in the country alone at two hundred millions
- οι· sesterces. He might have maintained no despicahle army at
his own eost. without the means of doing this, he thought that
no one desei-ved to be called rich. In other less stit-ring times he
might have lived and died without leaving in history any marked
traces of his existence ς but in the period of transition and commo-
tion which preceded the sali of the republic‚ such elementa ot· power
' as he possessed could scarcely remain neglected and quiescent.

It was part os the triumviral contract-renewed at an interview
between the parties in Luca—that Pompey aad Crassus should be
a second time consuls together, should share the armies and prov·
incas of the ensuing year, and should exert their influence to se-

and Crassus were elected consuls, Rc. 55. A law was passed, at
the rogation of the tribune C. Trebonius, by which syria and the
two Spains, with the right of peace and war, were assigned to the
consuls for five yearsz while the Gauls and Illyricum were handed
over to Caesar for a similar period. In the distribution of the con-
sular provinces, Crassus took Syria. ·

Crassus was anxious to distinguish himself in war. Pompey, he
saw, had subjugated the pirates and Mithradates ; Cesar had con-
quered Gaul, and was marching his army victoriously to Ger-many
and Britain. Mortified at successes which made him feel his inse-
riority to both, he chose rather to enter upon an undertaking sor
which he had no genius, than to eontinue the porsuit of wealth and

influence at home. Armed by the lex 'I'rebonia with power ιο ·

make war, he determined to exercise his authority hy attacking the
Parthians. This was a stretch and perversiori os the latr, for the
- Parthians were not expressly named in the lex Trebonia3 and the
senate, who constitutionally were the proper arbiters of peace and
war, refused to sanction hostilities by their decree. Indead, there
