Plautus .' dic. Plautus», the celebrated Roman comio poet, was a
native os Sarsina, in Umbria. He died in the year in which Cato θ
was censor, namely, Rc. 184.. The two comedies here mentioned,
the Tmculentus, or‘ ‘Clown‚” and the-Pseudolus, or‘ ‘Cheat,” were
two of his favorite pisces. They have both come down to us along
with eighteen others. -Livium Livius Andronicus, with whom
Roman literature properly begin& was a dramatis poet, who ficur-
ished about Rc. Mil—Cum fabulam docuisset. “Aster having ex-
hibited his first play.” More literally‚ ‘⁴ aster having taught a play
(to the actors33’ The expression docere fabulam is the same as the
Greek διδάσκειν δρᾶμα, and refers to the custom, on the part os the
scenio poets, of teaching the actors their parts, and superintending
the whole getting up and bringing out of their pieceS. Whether'
the play of Andronicus here alluded to was a tragedy or confedy is
uncertain—Centone Tuditanoque. C. Claudius Cento (son of Ap-
pius Claudius Caecus) and M. Sempronius Tuditanus, B.C. 240.

Ρ. Licinii Crassi. Already mentioned in Φ elz—Hujus P. Scipio-
nis. ⁴⁶ of the present Publius Scipio.” The allusion is to P. Scipio
Nasica, who was consul in B.c. 162, along with C. Marcius Figu-
lus; and who, in the year in which this discourse is supposed to
have been delivered, was Pontifex Maximae, and already advanced,

iu years—M. Cethegum. Marcus Cornelius Cethegus, who,was ¹

censor Rc. 209, with Ρ. Sempronius Tuditanus, and consul in Bc.
204, with the same colleague. His eloquence was rated very high,

and hence the epithet os Suadoe medulla, applied to him by Ennius

(Compare Brut, 15.) Horace twice refers to him as an ancient
authority sor the usage of Latin words. (Ep.‚ ii, 2, 116; Ep. ad
Pis, 503 and δάιοι, ad loo. )-Saadoe medullam. “The marrow of
Persuasion.’ ’' Equivalent to “qui Suada haret in medulli3,” i. e.,
the favor-ed child of Persuasion, and on whom ‘she has bestowed her
choicest gists. (Compare Aul. ὕεα, xii„ 2; xviii, 43 and Cic„
Ep. ad Fam, xv„ llio-Studia doctrina. Supply suna—Honestum.
