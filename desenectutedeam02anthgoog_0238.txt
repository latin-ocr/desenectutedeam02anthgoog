—Ut quidam docti. An allusion‚to the Stoice, and their imaginary
standard of virtue-*Qui mentm. ‘¹ Who are regarded as such in
the general opinion of mankind.”-Paulos, catam, ὀιο. “ The Pauli,
Catos,'' dcc„ i. a, such men as AEmilius Paulus, Cato, Gallus, the
Scipios, Philus. We have already made frequent mention ofAEmil-
ius Paulus, the conqueror os Macedonia, and of the elder Cato. By
Gallus is meant C. Sulpicius Gallus, with regard to whom consult
De Seneca, chap. xiv„ 6 49. By the Scipios he means the brothers
Publius and Cnoeus Scipio (compare De Seneca, chap. xx„ 9 75),
and the elder Africanus. Philus has been already mentioned in
chap. iv„ ᾁ 14.—cmnmunis vita. ‘⁸ The world as it goes-'’—Eosz

-Quoe non amici mutua, dte. ‘⁶ That does not repose uben the re-

Many os the commentatore regard these words, from Qua non antici
to tecum inclusive, as an additional quotation from Ennius, (Com-
pare Beier, ad loc„ and Ο. G. Jacob, ad Luciam, Tox. Prolegom„ p.
xxi.) We have preferred, however, following the authority οξ Orelli,

and assigning them to Cicero—Conquiescat. The subjtinctive is
the true reading here, not the indicative, because the relative clause

contains merely the enunciation os a supposed case—Quid dulcius,
quam habere, dcc. Beautifully enlarged upon by Seneca (De Tranq.
An, c. 7.)—Fructus. ‘⁴ Enjoyment.”——Opportunae sum* sing-ule, dcc.
“Are in general adapted each for specific ends.” ⁸ The idea of the
whole clause is this: Every other object of human desire is con-
