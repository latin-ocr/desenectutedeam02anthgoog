ιιι-«Ἥ AND CHA'RAC‘TER ou CRASSUS.²

. Μ. Lxcnnu· Cnosos Divus was the younger son of P. Licinius

‚erasm Dives, who was consul Rc. 97. The date of his birth is
not precisely recorded, but it is probable that he *was born about the

year Rc, 115, for Plutarch states that he was younger than Pom-
pey( Vit. Grau„ 6), and that he was more than sixty years old when
he departed (in the year Rc, 55) to make war against the Par-
thians. (lb, 17.) ,

In the year Rc. 87, when his father and brother suffered death

- for their resistance to Marius and Cinna, he was not considered of

sufficient importance to be involved in the same doom; but hc was
closely watched, and, after some tinie, he thought. it prudent to
make his escape to Spain, which he had visited some years before,
when his father had the command in that country. How he con·
cealed himself in a cavern near the sea, upon the estate of Vibius
Paciaecus, aud how hc passed his days in this strange retreat, is
related in detail by the lively and amusing pen of> Plutarch. Aster-
a retirement of eight months, the· death os Cinna (Rc. 84) relieved
him from his voluntary confinement. He put himself at the head
osa needy rabble, sor whose sustenance he provided by maranding
excursions, and, with twenty-five hundred men, made his way to
Malaca. Thence, seizing the vessels in the port, hc set sail for
Africa, where he met Q. Metellus Pius, who had escaped from the
“ party of Marius. He soon quan-eled with Metellus, and did not re-
main long in Africa3 for when Sulla (Bo. 83) lauded in Italy,
crassus proceeded to join that victorious general.

He was now brought into competition with Pompey, who also

served under Sulla. Τὴθ mind of Crassus was of an essentially .

vulgar type. He was noted for envy, but„ his envy was low and
caviling; it was not energetic enough to be cruel and revengeful,
even when successful ; and it was so fa? under the control os pusil-
lanimity a'nd sels-interest, as to abstain from the open opposition of
manly hatred. It was with lsuch feelings that Crassus regarded
Pompey; and Sulla played off the rivals against each other. He
