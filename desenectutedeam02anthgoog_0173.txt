Sabine territory, at a distance from his native town. It was here
that he passed the earlier and many os the later years of his life,
and hence the reference in the text to his country neighbors. (Com-

on, unless they themselves were present and took part in the same.
-Ρσνσὲγίιπάἑε, “ In gathering in.'’ (Compare Ptin„ H. N ., xvi., l t
“Perciperesructum ex ozea.”-)--1n aliis. “ In the case of other thingS,”
i. e.‚ in the case of those things which appertain unto, and intimately
concern thern.¹ Observe thatin aliis here stands opposed to in eis,
quae sciunt nihil ad se manino pertinere. Consult Klotz, ad loc„ who
correctly condemns the explanation of Orelli. Some read in illis,
‘⁸ scil. negotiis, quorum fructus annuus est,” as Ernesti explains it,
hut this is decidedly inferior. Madvig also gives in aliis, and in the
Greek version of Gaza we have ἐπὶ τῶν ‹laium—Nihil omuino ad se
pertinere. Compare the explanation ofBillerheck ε “ nullan} utilitatis
fructum sema ipsos inde csse capturos? ⁸

Ser-it arbores, &c- This line is commonly read and arranged as
follows: Serit arbores quoe alteri seculo prosim, and if we adopt this
as the correct form of the verse, it can not, of course, be scanned as
an iambictrimeter, even according to the comic scale, without vio-
lating tho mette, and we must come to the unavoidable conclusion
that Cicero quotes here from Statius, without regarding any metri-
cal arrangement of the words, and consequently that this quotation
” ought to be printed merely asso much prose; just as Moser has
given it in his edition of the Tusculan Disputations (i., 14), where it
also occurs. As this, however, might look like an avoiding of the
difficulty, we have preferred adopting the reading of Grotesend (cited

by Billerbeck), and which has been followed also by Spengel.
(Ην-03η. Stat.„p. ⁵0.) We have thus a good comio iambic trimeter:

ser-rt ᾱνῡιόνεε ῃ que ,εειιῡ prauam ᾶιιιεφῑ. ῃ

Hermann, however (Leipz. Lie.,·1819‚ p. 171), prefers regarding the
line as a Cretic tetrameter, and his opinion is adopted by Nobbe

and mnemon as weu as by a critic in the Heiaezb. Jahrb. a. mee.. '

1826, p. 984. Hermann’s arrangement is as follows ε
Serit
arbores, Ι quoe ᾶΙιέτῐ Ι siculo 1 prb-eiiam}
Ut ait Statius noster, διο. “ As our Statius says in ‘ The Youth·

ful comrades! ’⁷ This was a Greek comedy of Menander's‚ which
Statius has translated into Latin. Its Greek title was Συνεφηόοί.
