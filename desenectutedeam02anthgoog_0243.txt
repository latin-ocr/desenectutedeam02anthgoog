§ 30.

Ut enim quisque sibi plurimum confidit, ὀιο. Laelius here seta him-
self' m opposition to the Stoic doctrine, which maintained that the
sage was sufficient in himself for all things, and therefore stood in
no need of a friend. (Compare Seme„ Ep. ix. )-Ut nullo egeat.

“As to stand in need of no one to aid him. '—Quid enim. Equiva-
lent to the Greek τί γάρ. (consult Zumpt, ἦ ¹769.)—-Virtutt's ejus.
‘⁸ of his merit-'’—Auxit benevolentiam consuetudo. ⁴‘ Mutual inter-
course increased mutual esteem.'’—Non sunt tamen, &c ‘⁴ still
the motives for our leving one another did not arise from any ex-
pectation of these.”

<5 31.

Non ut exigam gratiam. ‘⁸ Not with the view of exacting a re-
·turn.”—Benefieium foencramur. ⁴⁶ Do we confer a kindness in the ’
hope of receiving a greater.” Foenerari properly means to lend out

, money on interest, ιο increase by means os interest ; and hence its

figurative use on the present occasion—Sed natura propensi, dcc.
Ernesti thinks that quia has fallen out from the text here. Not so,
however, by any means, if we regard the words sed natura .....
sumus as forming part of the parenthesis.

turn.”—Homsta certatio· ⁴‘ A contest of generosity.’‘-Erit et gra-
