Thais did indeed return me many thanks 2⁹⁹ This line is quoted
from the ‘⁸ Eunuchus'’ of Terence (iii, 151), and is uttered by Thraso,
a braggart captain, to his parasite Gnatho, who had just conveyed
Pamphila as a present from Thraso to Thais, Thraso and Gnatho
ere represented ss coming on the stage in the middle of a dlalogue,
and hence the apparently abrupt commencement of the scene. The
most natural mode of supplying the ellipsis is by aisne tu. Some
less correctly regard agere here as an historical infinitivo. The line
is a comio iambic trimeter, and is scanned as follows:

the ⁸ Heiress,' i. e., as it 'does in the comedy of Caecilius, entitled
Epiclerus (Ἐπίκληρος), or “- the Heiress.” Aster ut supply id accidit,

versaris and 'manseris are both in the future perfect. Emunoeeris
is Bentley’s emendation for the common unxeris, and suits better ·
the character of a master addressing his slave. The lines are comic
iambic trimeters, and scanned as follows:
