we have, in Ep. ed Fam, it, 18, tho epitheto sumemus aad doo-
tissima joined together, and in Or. pro Flave„ 20, ⁸⁸ hanina frugal-
issimi ee sanctissimi.”—Quid moror in terris ,ἲ dte. Compare the
well-known doctrine of the Stoics, that the sage might, and even
ought, on some occasione, to depart from existence εὐλόγῳ ἐξαγωγῇ.
(ῙᾹΡι, Μαπιιᾶυστ., ad Stoic. Philon„ iii„ 22.)--Nisi enim Deus is, dte.
Compare Plat„ Phoeaon, p. 62, seeph. .· ὁ μὲν οὖν ἐν ἀπορῤἧτοις λεγό-
μενος . . . . λόγος, ὡς ἔναυε φρουρᾷ ἐσμεν οἱ ἅνθρωποι, καὶ οὐ δεῖ δὴ

Qui tuerentur. illum globum. ‘⁸ To be faithful guardiane of that
globe,” i. e.‚ to dwell thereon as faithml conservatore and inhabit-
ants os the same, until it shall plesse the Deity to remove them.
observo that qui ie here equivalent to ut iun· (Zumpt, ο 656), and
that the imperfect is employed to denote the deeign of the Deity in
creating man—In hoc templo. Tne universe is here aptly called the
temple of the Deity. Compare Macrobius (ad Somn. scip„ i., 14):
‘⁴ Bene autem unionem mundus dei templum vocatur? dte—Divinis
animato mribus. On the divinity of the stare, compare Cic„ N.
D„ ii., 15.-0ircos euos orbesque. ‘⁶ Their circuite and orbits.” We
have given circos here, with Ochsner, Nobbe, and Orelli, a form em· ,
ployed also by Cicero in the translations from Aratus, v. 248.
Other editors give effredus. -·- Injuesu ojus. Compare De Samot,

Sed cic. ‘⁸ But remaining thu's,” i. a, but while in this life—Am

thet flammas is here equivalent to sidera. -- Orbem lacteum. The

Greek term is manicae—Ex qno omnia mhi contemplanti, άο. Tho ,

ᾗουῐιςοι· Africanus imagines himself, also, to be standing in a part
of the Milky Way, as well es the elder Scipio. Compare the ex-
planation os Macrobius (acl Somn. δαέρα, ἰ., 4): ‘⁸ Sciendum est, quod
locus, in quo eibi esse videtin· Scipio per quietem, lacteus circulus eet,
qui galasius vocatur-3⁹ 'Pliis is all very appropriate, since the an-
