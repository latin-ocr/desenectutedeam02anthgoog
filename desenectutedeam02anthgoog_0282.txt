Quid horum. ‘⁴ What one of these things.” The reference is to
praise and gluwe-An quisquam in potiundis voluptatibus, duc. ‘⁶ Or
does any one, amid the enjoyment of pleasures, elevate himself in
glory and in good reportw ι’. 3., does any one find that the enjoy-
ment os pleasures is a title to honor and glory 3—-Demovet A met-
aphor borrowed from the movements of combatants.

PARADOXON Π.

ln quo virm-2 eit, dec. This εέωιέεἰιωθοι is handled more at large
in the fisth book of the Tusculan Disputations, under the title .“ Vir-

· tutem ad beate vivendum ee ipsa esse contentam.”—Nec vero ego, dcc.

Some editors, in order ιο avoid the appearance os abruptness in this
commencement, suppose the present Paradox to be intimately con-
nected with, and to fioW, as it were, from the preceding one. It is
better, however, to regard the whole piece as a fragment from an
oration against Clodius, who had attacked Cicero on account of the
alleged illegality os the condemnation os the followers of Catiline;
and as being here introduced for the purpose os showing in what way
general propositions, of a philosophical nature, may be made to have
a special application. (Compare Billerbeck, ad loc.)—M. Regulum.
Compare De Seneca, xx„ ᾧ 75. Cicero appears nowhere to have
had any doubts respecting the actual punishment os Regulus by the
Carthaginians.-—Magnitudo animi. ‘⁶ His losty spirit.”—Gravitas.
“ His rectitude of principle,” i. e., his remaining true to his char-
acter, and not allowing himself to be intimidated by the sear of a
cruel punishment, so as to recommend impolitic and dishonorable
terms to· his countrymen. — Qui, tot virtutum prasidio, διο. “ For
he, through the safeguard and the glorious retinue of so many vir·
tues.” There is no need os our inserting septus, or circumseptus,
or munitus into the text, after contituta, as some editors have done;
for prasidio and comitatu are causal ablative3‚ and require nothing
ιο be added. ⁴

Ο. vero Marium vidimus. Marius died B.c. 86, when Cicero was
inhis twenty-first year. The works of Cicero offer many prooss of
his attachment to the memory of Marius. While still a young man,
he celebrated his praises in a poem named aster him. (De Lag„ i.,
1.) He constantly cites him as a model os contage and firmness of
soul. (Or, in Vera, v., 103 pro Bam, 2⁰, aeq„- in Pis„ 19ς Tum,
ii.‚ 153 De Ru„ ii„ 32, διο.) He compares his own exile ιο that
es Marius (Post red. ad Quin, 8; pro Sext„ 22„ and he mentions,
