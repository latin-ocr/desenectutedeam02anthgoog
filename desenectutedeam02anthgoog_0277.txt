smne time called into play by him.’‘’ Those who wish to read, with
Lambinus, nullis oratoriis ornamentis adhibitis, mistake Cicero’s
meaning entirely. Cicero always speaks os Cato as an eloquent
man (Brut, xxxi„ ἀει), and he merely wishes to state here, that he
only introduced into his orations philosophie discussions on those
points in which the Stoics did not differ very widely from other
sects. He himself, however, intends to treat of their Paradoxes,
which Cato did not dc, and hence the expression feci etiam auda-
cium—Quae vix in gymnasiis, dcc. “Which the Stoics prove with
difficulty in their schools and momente os leisure, ” i. e„ find it a. .
difficult matter to prove either ιιι their public disputatione, or their
