which was the appointment of Marius to the command of the war
against Mithradates. This gave occasion to Sulla’s catering Rome
at the head of his legions. Marius saved himself by ssight, but Sul-
picius was put to death—Anicia. The daughter of Pomponius’s
aunt—M. Seruio. M. servius Sulpicius. The gens Sulpicia ap-
pear stom this to have admitted a double praenomen, which was an
unusual circumstance. Consult Fischer’s note on the present pas·
saga—Cinnano mauu. ⁸⁴ By Cinna’s tumult.” The term tumult-
υ is meant to be a very emphatic one here, and refers to the fright-.
ful scenes os slaughter that ensued at Rome, when Cinna and Ma-
rius entered it with their armed followers. (Eutrop, v., 7.)·

Atticus and the younger Marius had been, as already remarked, old

Nam prater gratiam, dcc. ‘⁴ For, independently of his engaging
manner, which was already very conspicuous in him while, as yet,
a very young man.” Compare Taschucke's explanation of gratiam ’
here: “Ita panim de moribus, qui placent, gratiam conciliant.” Des-
curet is altogether wrong in rendering it by the French term cre‘dit.
“ —Vmuram facere publice. ‘⁴ Το change a public creditor‚” i. a, to
bon-ow money of one in order to pay another some deht due by the
state. The term vasam means, properly, a turning or changing,
and hence vermi-am facere is to change a creditor, or to borrow of
one to pay another. Compare Donatus, ad Tarm„ Phor-m„ v„ 2,

Ejus conditionem aquam. “Fair terme for* obtaining it (from oth-
ers),’' i. ι., could only procure the requisite loan from the bankers
or usurers of the day at a heav‘y rate of interest.— Usum-am. ‘⁶ In· a
