Senes. In Sparta the senate was called the γερουσία, or Assembly
of Elders, and its members γέροῖιτες. The Spartan γερουσία included
the two kings, who were its presidente, and consisted of thirty mem-
bers 3 and the kings themselves, as sar as their votes were con-
cerned, ranked merely as ordinary senatore. This will serve to
throw light on the expression amplissimum magistratum, which, as
employed in -the text, comprehende the kings also—Externa.
‘⁸ Thinge relating to foreign lands.” Equivalent to historiam exter-
nam.

Cedo. “Tell ue, pray.’' The singular sor the plural cedite, just
as we sometimes find age sor agite, as in Cic. pro Leg. Mami, 14:
‘⁴ Age vero ..... considerate.” The line in the text is taken from
the old poet Naevius, and is a comic iambic tetrameter acatalectic,
or octonarius, consisting of four mensures, ὁι· eight feet, The scan-
ning is as follows:

,Cedo qui Ι υὲεινᾱπι ΙΙ νέπῳᾰὺῑΙῖσᾶηι ΙΙ tantam almisietuis tdm Ι οῖίὄ ,7 ss

' Sic enim percontantur, &c ‘⁴ For so they put the question, as we

sind it in the ‘'Ludus’ os Noevius,” i. e., sor such is the question put·
by some os the characters in the comedy of Naevius, entitled ‘⁴ Lu·

das,” or the School. Naevius was one of the early Roman poete,

having been born somewhere between 2⁷4 and 264 Rc. He was

contemporary, therefore, with Cato, though much the older os the

two, Naevius composed tragedies, comedies, and also an epic poem

on the First Punic War‚ during the latter part os which contest he

had persorn'ned military service—Proveniebane oratores nom, ew.

‘⁶ There came forth a crop of demagogues of low birth, scole, mere

striplings.” Observe that novi is here equivalent to ignobiles, We

have placed a comma after stulti, with Madvig and Nauck, which

rendere the line a more emphatic one, and produces a species of

parallelism between stulti and adolescentuli. Lambinus, instead of ,
proveniebant oratores, gives provehebantur ad res from a single MS.,

but the line with this change violates the metre. The verse is a

eomic trochaic tetrameter catalectic, in which novi is to be pro·

nonnced as a monosyllable, as in Plautus, Mil„ iii„ 1, 30: ·
