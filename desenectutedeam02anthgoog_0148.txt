thet the final dyuebie in verm is lengthened here by-the mik, ee
that there is no need of reading neb for in, as some ‹lo—Proemt,
for premii. Some MSS. and editions have pretii, which is con·
demned by Bentley (ad Ter„ Anam ii.‚ 1, 20), who maintains that
no poet before Propertius employed the double i in the genitive
siugular. (Compare Zumpt, 949, note 1.) θ .
Ille vir, haud magna cum re, doc. “That man, with no great
wealth indeed, yet rich in trustworthiness,” i. a, poor in point of
worldly means, but rich in all that is worthy os reliance on the part
os his senemr-men. Commentators generally suppose that Ennius
is meant, and that Cicero here describes him by a line drawn from
one of his poems, but referring there to some other person. Dra·
kenhoreh, however, more cortenay, refers this verse' to Sextus
AElius Poetus, already mentioned, and thinks that Cicero meant this
individual, not Ennius—Pleni? fidei. Observe here the elision os
the final s in plenus, before a consonant, in the beginning of the next
word. The earlier Latin poets were in the habit of frequently eli-
ding the letter s, in words ending in 'is and ἴω, when followed by a
word beginning with a consonant, and thus permitting the vowel to
remain short—Fidei. As regards the penult in this word, ponsult

Sollicitari te, Tite, dre. Another quotation from EnniuS, but prob·
ably only in part, the first portion ot· the line being, in all likelihbod‚
from the pen os Cicero himself. The verse in Ennius runs as fol·
lows: ‘⁴ Et qna deprimeris frit-'tra noctesque diesque? Consult, how-
ever, Galama, ad loc„ p. 14o.—M0derauemm animi tui, ὄις. “ Your
moderation and even temper of mind ;'’ more literally, ‘⁶ the mod-
eration of your mind, and your equanimityss” ⁴ As regards the mod·
eration of Atticus, compare Nep„ Aee„ c. 14. Observe, moreovffier,
that aequitas is here equivalent to mutabilitas, os which Cicero him-
self gives us the definition elsewhere (Off, i., 26, 2): ‘⁴ Proeolara
est aeqnabilitas in omni vita, iden} semper υιιὶειω, eademque fron-'3’
cognomen Athenis deportasse. His surname of Atticus appears to
have been given him on account of his long residence at Athens
(twenty years), but more particularly on account of his intimate ac-
quaintance with the language and literature of Greece. (Compare
Cic„ de Fin„ v. 23 Nep„ Act„ c. 3, 4.)—·Humanitatem et prudentiam.
‘⁴ The philosophie calmness of a cultivated intelleot, as well as a pm-
dent spirit.'’ Observe the peculiar force os homnitatem, a term
which some explain here by ⁸⁴ polite learning,” and others by ⁴⁴ a
