here wit-h Ernesti, Wetzel, Schiitz, Orelli, and Madvig. Some edi·
tors omit it; others read eam-In sabulis. Wetzel instances OEdi-
pus, Cyrus, Paris, Romulus, &c.—-In famulatu. “In a menial con-
dition.”—-Fructus enim ingenii et virtutis. This is the construction
which is so osten mistaken by modern Latinists, who substitute for
the genitive the proposition ex with the ablativo.

In anticitiae conjunctionisque necessitudine. “ In the close relation
of friendship and intimate union‚‘’ i. e., when closely related either
in friendshIp or any other intimate union. Seyffert refers conjunc-

they can point to some trait os friendship in which they have mani-
fested their zeal, their attachment, and their willingness to encoun·
ter labor.‚—0dioeum sane genus hominurn. Not an interjectione!

ed.”, Equivalent to negligi—Qui etiam contemnendos se arbitrantur.
‘⁶ Who even think themselves deserving of being thus slighted,” i. ι..
who entertain too low an opinion os their own merit—Hac opinione
mandi sunt. ‘⁸ Are to be relieved from this opinion.” — Opere.
