principal objections are stated and refuted in regular succession.
Itis held that old age is wretched : 1. Because it incapacitates men
for active business; 2. Because it readers the body seeble; 3. Be·
cause it deprives them of the enjoyment 01· almost au pleasures; 4.
Because it heralds the near approach 01· death. The first three are
met by producing examples 01· many illustrious personages, iu whom
old age was not attended by any of these evils3 by arguing that 811011
privations aru not real, but imaginary, missortunes3 and that, 11· 1110
relish for some pleasures is lost, other delights os a more desirable
and substantial character are substituted. The fourth objection 18
encountered still more boldly by an eloquent declaration that the
chief happiness 01· 0111 age, in the eyes 01· the philosopher, arises
from the conviction that it indicates the near approach of death,
’ 11101 18, 1110 near approach 01· the period when the soul shall be re—
1008οᾶ from its debasing connection with the body, and enter un-
fettercd upon the paths of immortality. This piece has always been
deservedly admired as one 01· 1110 111081 gracesul moral essays be-
queathed to 118 by antiquity. The purity 01· 1110 language, the live-
liness 01· 1110 illustratione, the dignity 01· 1110 sentimenta, and the
tact with which 1110 character 01· 1110 strong-minded, but sels-satisfied
and garrulous old man is maintained, have excited universal ap-
plause. But, however pleasing the picture here presented to us,
every one must pereeive that it is a fancy sketch, not the faithful
copy of a scene from nature. In fact, the whole treatise is a 118800
of special pleading, 011 0 question which is discussed in the 801110
1000 of extravagance, on the opposite side, by Juvenal in his tenth
satire. The logie, also, is bad ; scrin several instances general prop-
ositions are attaeked by a few specious particular cases, which are
mere exceptione to the mle. No one 0011 doubt the truth 01· the as-
sertions, that old age does incapacitate us sor active business, that
it does render the body feeble, aud that it does blunt the keenness
o'f our senses; but, while it is a persectly fair style 01· argumenbto
maintain that these are imaginary and not real 1118, 11 18 utterly ab-
80111 10 deny their existence because history affords a few instances
of‘favored individuale who have been exempted from their influence.
