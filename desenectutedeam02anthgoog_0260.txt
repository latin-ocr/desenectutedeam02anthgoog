abilities to sumaim—Quamvis licet excellas. ‘⁶ However much you·
may' excel,” i. e., how great soever your authority and influence
may be.—P. Rupilium. Publius Rupilius Rufus was consul with
P. Popilius Laenas, Rc, 132, and was remarkable for the severity
he displayed toward the followers of Tiberius Gracchus, aster the
death of that tribune. (Vell. Patara, ii„ 7.) The common text has
Rutilium, which Ernesti improperly retains. In like manner we
must read Rupilius in Tusa, iv., 17, 9 40, where the same editor in-
correctly gives Rutilius.÷Lucium. L. Rupilius Rufus. The re-
membrance os his brother’s severity, toward the partisans of the
Agrarian laW, alienated the favor of the people, and caused his de-
feat. Pliny says that P. Rupilius, who was laboring under a slight
illness at the time, when he heard of his brother’s repulse immedi-
ately expired. (Ptin, H. N., vii„ 36. Compare Cia, Tusa, iv„
17, g> 40.) ·

Omnino amicitia, dic. “ As a universal rule, friendships are then
first to be judged of when both our judgments and our years are
now strengthened and matured,” i. e., when our minds and charac-
ters have attained to a certain degree of firmness through maturet
years—Eos habere necessarios, διο. “Are they to be deemed to
have those as intimate friendS, whom they have loved at that season
of lise, because actuated by a fondness for the same pursuits.'' We
must supply judicandi aunt before eos habere necessarios, the idea os
this being suggested by judicanda sunt which precedes. Beier less
neatly= supplies judicandum est, which will give rise to the inelegant
construction eos eos hahere necessarios. Compare Seyffert, ad loc.—
Jure decantatis. “Through the right os old acquaintance.”—Sed alio
quodam modo. Goerenz supplies here curandi. The true ellipsis,
however, is merely negligendi non sant in the sense os diligendi aunt.

Aliter amicitia, &c The idea intended to be conveyed is this,
that were our early attachments the just foundation of amity, it
would be impossible for the union ever to be permanent, since our
inclinations and pursuits take a different turn as we advance into
riper years—Mores. “ Habits.'’—Distantia. ‘⁶ Difference.” Er·
nesti objects to distantia, and thinks that we should read here dis-
sensio. It is true, the substantive distantia occurs nowhere else in
Cicero ; still, however, it is sufficiently defended by the employment
of dis-tare and distans (Orat, x., 34: “ Quid enim tam distans quam a
severitate comitas 3⁹³) as well as by the analogy of discrepantia and
